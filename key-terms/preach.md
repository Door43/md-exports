preach
======

Definition:
-----------

To speak to a group of people, teaching them about God and urging them
to obey him.

-   Usually preaching is done by one person to a large group of people.
-   “Preaching” and “teaching” are similar, but not the same.
    “Preaching” mainly refers to public proclamation of spiritual
    or moral truth, and urging the audience to respond. “Teaching”
    emphasizes instruction, that is, imparting knowledge or skill to
    the learner.
-   John the Baptist, Jesus, and the apostles often preached to people
    that they should repent and enter the kingdom of God.

Examples from the Bible stories:
--------------------------------

     **preached** to them, saying, “Repent, for the Kingdom of God
    is near!” Jesus sent his apostles to **preach** and to teach people
    in many different villages.  About three years after Jesus first began
    **preaching** and teaching publicly, Jesus told his disciples that he
    wanted to celebrate this Passover with them in Jerusalem, and that
    he would be killed there.  But in spite of this, they **preached**
    about Jesus everywhere they went.
     went to Samaria where he preached about Jesus and many
    people were saved.  Right away, Saul began **preaching** to the
    Jews in Damascus, saying, “Jesus is the Son of God!” Then they
    sent them off to **preach** the good news of Jesus in many other
    places.  Paul and other Christian leaders traveled to many cities,
    **preaching** and teaching people the good news about Jesus.  When
    Jesus was living on earth he said, “My disciples will **preach**
    the good news about the kingdom of God to people everywhere in the
    world, and then the end will come.”
