Examples from the Bible stories:
--------------------------------

    **Joseph's** brothers hated him because their father loved him
    most and because Joseph had dreamed that he would be their ruler.
    The slave traders took **Joseph** to Egypt.  Even in prison,
    **Joseph** remained faithful to God, and God blessed him.  God had
    given **Joseph** the ability to interpret dreams, so Pharaoh had
    Joseph brought to him from the prison.  **Joseph** told the people
    to store up large amounts of food during the seven years of good
    harvests.  The Egyptians no longer remembered **Joseph** and all he
    had done to help them.
