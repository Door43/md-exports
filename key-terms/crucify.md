crucify
=======

Definition:
-----------

To crucify someone is to tie him or hang him to a cross and leave him
there to suffer and die in great pain.

-   People who were crucified died from either blood loss or
    suffocation.
-   Crucifixion was a common method that the Roman Empire used to
    execute the worst criminals or people who had rebelled against the
    authority of Rome.
-   The Roman Empire used professional executioners to crucify people.
    These executioners made crucifixions as long and as painful as
    possible.
-   During the time of Jesus, Rome ruled the Jews and did not allow them
    to execute a criminal. When the Jewish religious leaders wanted to
    kill Jesus, they had to ask the Roman governor to order his soldiers
    to crucify Jesus.
-   The Romans crucified Jesus by nailing him to a cross. He suffered
    for six hours, and then died.

Examples from the Bible stories:
--------------------------------

    But the Jewish leaders and the crowd shouted, “**Crucify** him
    !” Pilate became afraid that the crowd would begin to riot, so
    he ordered his soldiers to **crucify** Jesus.  After the soldiers
    mocked Jesus, they led him away to **crucify** him. They made him
    carry the cross on which he would die.  Jesus was **crucified**
    between two robbers.  “Men of Israel, Jesus was a man who did many
    mighty signs and wonders by the power of God, as you have seen and
    already know. But you **crucified** him!” “You **crucified**
    this man, Jesus.” Peter answered them, “This man stands before
    you healed by the power of Jesus the Messiah. You **crucified**
    Jesus, but God raised him to life again!”
