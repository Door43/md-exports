Examples from the Bible stories:
--------------------------------

    The snake who deceived Eve was **Satan**. The promise meant that
    the Messiah who would come would defeat **Satan** completely.
    Then **Satan** showed Jesus all the kingdoms of the world and all
    their glory and said, “I will give you all this if you bow down
    and worship me.” Jesus did not give in to **Satan's** temptations,
    so **Satan** left him.  Jesus explained, “The seed is the word
    of God. The path is a person who hears God’s word, but does not
    understand it, and the **devil** takes the word from him.” After
    Judas took the bread, **Satan** entered into him.  God promised
    that one of Eve’s descendants would crush **Satan’s** head,
    and **Satan** would wound his heel. This meant that **Satan**
    would kill the Messiah, but God would raise him to life again,
    and then the Messiah will crush the power of **Satan** forever.
    God has taken you out of **Satan’s** kingdom of darkness and
    put you into God’s kingdom of light.  “The weeds represent
    the people who belong to the **evil one**. The enemy who planted
    the weeds represents the **devil**.” “When the world ends,
    the angels will gather together all the people who belong to the
    **devil** and throw them into a raging fire, where they will cry
    and grind their teeth in terrible suffering.” When Jesus returns,
    he will completely destroy **Satan** and his kingdom. He will throw
    **Satan** into hell where he will burn forever, along with everyone
    who chose to follow him rather than to obey God.
