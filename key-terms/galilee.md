Examples from the Bible stories:
--------------------------------

    The prophet Isaiah said the Messiah would live in **Galilee**,
    comfort broken-hearted people, and proclaim freedom to captives and
    release to prisoners.  After overcoming Satan’s temptations, Jesus
    returned in the power of the Holy Spirit to the region of **Galilee**
    where he lived.  Finally, the people said, “We know that you were
    with Jesus because you both are from **Galilee**.” Then the angel
    told the women, “Go and tell the disciples, ‘Jesus has risen
    from the dead and he will go to **Galilee** ahead of you.’”
