Holy Spirit
===========

###

Facts:
------

The Holy Spirit is God. The one true God exists eternally as the Father,
the Son, and the Holy Spirit. All three are equal in every way.

-   Because the Holy Spirit is God, the Holy Spirit is absolutely holy,
    infinitely pure, and morally perfect in all his nature and in
    everything he does.
-   The Holy Spirit was active, along with the Father and the Son, in
    creating the world.
-   In the past the Holy Spirit sometimes came to people briefly to give
    them a special message or to enable them to do great things.
-   When God's Son, Jesus, returned to heaven, God sent the Holy Spirit
    to his people to lead them, teach them, comfort them and give them
    the ability to do God's will.

Examples from the Bible stories:
--------------------------------

    But **God's Spirit** was there over the water.  When Jesus came
    up out of the water after being baptized, **the Spirit of God**
    appeared in the form of a dove and came down and rested on him.
    After overcoming Satan's temptations, Jesus returned in the power
    of **the Holy Spirit** to the region of Galilee where he lived.
    Jesus read, “God has given me **his Spirit** so that I can proclaim
    good news to the poor, freedom to captives, recovery of sight for the
    blind, and release to the oppressed.” “So go, make disciples of
    all people groups by baptizing them in the name of the Father, the
    Son, and **the Holy Spirit** and by teaching them to obey everything
    I have commanded you.” They were all filled with the **Holy Spirit**
    and they began to speak in other languages.  “And Jesus has sent the
    **Holy Spirit** just as he promised he would do. The **Holy Spirit**
    is causing the things that you are are now seeing and hearing.”
    Peter answered them, “Every one of you should repent and be baptized
    in the name of Jesus Christ so that God will forgive your sins. Then
    he will also give you the gift of the **Holy Spirit**.”
     had a good reputation and was full of the **Holy Spirit**
    and of wisdom.
