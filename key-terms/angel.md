Definition:
-----------

An angel is a powerful spirit being whom God created. These spirit
beings exist to serve God by doing whatever he tells them to do. They
serve God in different ways:

-   They give people messages from God, including commands and other
    instructions.
-   They protect and strengthen people.  -   They guard people and places.

Sometimes in the Bible “the angel of Yahweh” is used to refer to
God himself.

The opposite of “angel” is a “demon.”

Examples from the Bible stories:
--------------------------------

    God placed large, powerful **angels** at the entrance to the
    garden to keep anyone from eating the fruit of the tree of life.
    The **angel** responded to Zechariah,”I was sent by God to bring
    you this good news.” Suddenly, a shining **angel** appeared to
    them , and they were terrified. The **angel** said, “Do not be
    afraid, because I have some good news for you.” Suddenly, the
    skies were filled with **angels** praising God… Then **angels**
    came and took care of Jesus.  Jesus was very troubled and his sweat
    was like drops of blood. God sent an **angel** to strengthen him.
    could ask the Father for an army of **angels** to defend me.”
