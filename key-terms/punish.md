punish
======

###

Definition:
-----------

To punish someone is to cause that person to suffer a negative consequence
for doing something wrong.

-   God punished the Israelites when they disobeyed him, especially when
    they worshiped false gods.
-   Sometimes punishment is intended to motivate a person to stop
    sinning, as when God punished the Israelites.
-   Jesus was punished for all the evil things that every person has
    ever done. He received each person's punishment on himself even
    though he did nothing wrong and did not deserve that punishment.

Examples from the Bible stories:
--------------------------------

    God also gave many other laws and rules to follow. If the
    people obeyed these laws, God promised that he would bless and
    protect them. If they disobeyed them, God would **punish** them.
    Because the Israelites kept disobeying God, he **punished** them
    by allowing their enemies to defeat them.  The prophets warned the
    people that if they did not stop doing evil and start obeying God,
    then God would judge them as guilty, and he would **punish** them.
    Jesus was the perfect high priest because he took the **punishment**
    for every sin that anyone has ever committed.  When anyone believes
    in Jesus, the blood of Jesus takes away that person’s sin, and
    God’s **punishment** passes over him.  But God loved everyone in
    the world so much that he gave his only Son so that whoever believes
    in Jesus will not be **punished** for his sins, but will live with
    God forever.  Jesus never sinned, but he chose to be **punished**
    and die as the perfect sacrifice to take away your sins and the sins
    of every person in the world.
