guilt
=====

###

Definition:
-----------

Guilt is the fact of having sinned or committed a crime.

-   To be guilty means, “to have done something morally wrong,”
that is,
    “to have disobeyed God.”
-   People who are guilty deserve to be punished.  -   Some languages
might translate “guilt” as, “the weight of one's
    sins” or, “the counting of one's sins.”

The opposite of “guilty” is “innocent.”

See also: **innocent**, **sin**, **punish**

Examples from the Bible stories:
--------------------------------

    They brought many witnesses who lied about him . However, their
    statements did not agree with each other, so the Jewish leaders
    could not prove he was **guilty** of anything.  After speaking with
    Jesus, Pilate went out to the crowd and said, “I find no **guilt**
    in this man.” But the Jewish leaders and the crowd shouted,
    “Crucify him!” Pilate replied, “He is not **guilty**.” But
    they shouted even louder. Then Pilate said a third time, “He is
    not **guilty**!” Jesus was crucified between two robbers. One of
    them mocked Jesus, but the other said, “Don’t you fear God? We
    are **guilty**, but this man is innocent.  Because of your sin,
    you are **guilty** and deserve to die.
