Promised Land
=============

###

Facts:
------

This was the land that God had promised to give to Abraham and his
descendants.

-   After Abraham's descendants had lived in Canaan for many years,
    there was a famine and they had to move to the country of Egypt.
    Over 400 years later, God brought them back to Canaan.
-   Canaan was also called the “Promised Land” by Abraham's
descendants.  -   Because of Israel's disobedience, God took the people
out of Canaan
    for seventy years during the Exile. Then, he brought them back to
    the Promised land again.

Examples from the Bible stories:
--------------------------------

    They  were no longer slaves, and they were going to the **Promised
    Land**!  After God had told the Israelites the laws he wanted
    them to obey as part of his covenant with them, God began leading
    them from Mount Sinai toward the **Promised Land**, which was
    also called Canaan.  God had promised Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob
    that he would give the **Promised Land** to their descendants, but
    now there were many people groups living there.  Then God led the
    people to the edge of the **Promised Land** again.  The Israelites
    had to cross the Jordan River to enter into the **Promised Land**.
    After this battle, God gave each tribe of Israel its own section of
    the **Promised Land**.  This period of time when God's people were
    forced to leave the **Promised Land** is called the Exile.
