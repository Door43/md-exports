Examples from the Bible stories:
--------------------------------

    One day, Jesus received a message that **Lazarus** was very sick.
    **Lazarus** and his two sisters, Mary and Martha, were close friends
    of Jesus.  Jesus said, “Our friend **Lazarus** has fallen asleep,
    and I must wake him.” Jesus' disciples replied, “Master, if
    **Lazarus** is sleeping, then he will get better.” Then Jesus
    told them plainly, “**Lazarus** is dead.” When Jesus arrived at
    **Lazarus'** hometown, **Lazarus** had already been dead for four
    days.  Jesus asked them, “Where have you put **Lazarus**?” Then
    Jesus shouted, “**Lazarus**, come out!” **Lazarus** came out! He
    was still wrapped in grave clothes.  But the religious leaders of
    the Jews were jealous, so they gathered together to plan how they
    could kill Jesus and **Lazarus**.
