Facts:

Jericho was a powerful city in the Promised Land of Canaan.

-   This was the first city in the land of Canaan that God told the
    Israelites to conquer.
-   Like all the Canaanites, the people of Jericho worshiped false
    idols.
-   When Joshua led the Israelites against Jericho, God did a great
    miracle to help them defeat the city.

Examples from the Bible stories:
--------------------------------

    Joshua sent two spies to the Canaanite city of **Jericho**.  After the
    people crossed the Jordan River, God told Joshua how to attack the
    powerful city of **Jericho**.  Then the walls around **Jericho**
    fell down! The Israelites destroyed everything in the city as God
    had commanded.
