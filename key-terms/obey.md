obey
====

Definition:
-----------

To obey is to follow the law or to do what someone in authority commands.

-   When the law or someone in authority commands people to do
    something, they obey by doing it.
-   When the law or someone in authority commands people not to do
    something, they obey by not doing it.

The only person who completely obeyed God was Jesus Christ, and him
alone. The opposite of “obey” is “disobey.”

Examples from the Bible stories:
--------------------------------

    Noah **obeyed** God. He and his three sons built the boat just the
    way God had told them.  Again Abraham **obeyed** God and prepared
    to sacrifice his son.  “Because you  have **obeyed** me, all
    the families of the world will be blessed through your family”
    But the Egyptians did not believe God or **obey** his commands.
    the people **obeyed** these laws, God promised that he would bless
    and protect them.
