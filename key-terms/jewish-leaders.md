Jewish leaders
==============

###

Facts:
------

The Jewish leaders were religious leaders, such as priests and experts
in God's laws.

-   Many of the religious leaders did not believe that Jesus was the
    Messiah and Son of God. They were jealous of Jesus and did not want
    other people to believe in him either.
-   Some of the religious leaders did believe in Jesus–especially after
    he rose from the dead.
-   Many of the religious leaders believed that they were more righteous
    than other people, and they were too proud to admit their sins. They
    lied about Jesus to the Roman rulers and demanded that he be killed.
-   Jesus condemned the Jewish leaders for being hypocrites. They
    claimed to know God, but did not obey him.

Examples from the Bible stories:
--------------------------------

    Many **religious leaders** also came to be baptized by John, but they
    did not repent or confess their sins.  But the **religious leaders
    of the Jews** were jealous, so they gathered together to plan how
    they could kill Jesus and Lazarus.
     knew that the **Jewish leaders** denied that Jesus was the
    Messiah and that they were plotting to kill him.  The **Jewish
    leaders**, led by the high priest, paid Judas thirty silver coins to
    betray Jesus.  The **Jewish leaders** all answered the high priest,
    “He deserves to die!” Early the next morning, the **Jewish
    leaders** brought Jesus to Pilate, the Roman governor.  But the
    **Jewish leaders** and the crowd shouted, “Crucify him!” Then
    Joseph and Nicodemus, two **Jewish leaders** who believed Jesus
    was the Messiah, asked Pilate for Jesus’ body.  The next day,
    the **Jewish leaders** brought Peter and John to the high priest
    and the other **religious leaders**.
