Facts:
------

The Amorites were a group of people living in Canaan in the time of
Joshua.

-   The Amorites lived in cities on both sides of the Jordan River. Each
    city was ruled by a king.
-   God had promised to give the Israelites the land of Canaan,
    including the land of the Amorites.

Examples from the Bible stories:
--------------------------------

    Sometime later, the kings of another people group in Canaan, the
    **Amorites**, heard that the Gibeonites had made a peace treaty with
    the Israelites, so they combined their armies into one large army and
    attacked Gibeon.  the early morning they surprised the **Amorite**
    armies and attacked them.  God fought for Israel that day. He caused
    the **Amorites** to be confused and he sent large hailstones that
    killed many of the **Amorites**.  God also caused the sun to stay
    in one place in the sky so that Israel would have enough time to
    completely defeat the **Amorites**.
