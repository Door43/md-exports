god

###

Definition:
-----------

A god is something that people worship because they believe it has great
power to affect their lives.

-   When god is written with a small 'g,' it refers to a false god.
-   When God is written with a capital 'G,' it refers to the one and
    only true God.
-   These “gods” do not exist. Yahweh is the only God, and he has no
    rival.
-   People sometimes make idols as symbols of their false gods.  -
Demons often deceive people into believing that these false gods and
    their idols have power.

Examples from the Bible stories:
--------------------------------

    Through these plagues, God showed Pharaoh that he is more powerful
    than Pharaoh and all of Egypt’s **gods**.  Then God gave them
    the covenant and said, “I am Yahweh, your God, who saved you from
    slavery in Egypt. Do not worship other **gods**.” They  worshiped
    false **gods** and did many evil things.  The Israelites began to
    worship the Canaanite **gods** instead of Yahweh, the true God.
    But most of Judah’s kings were evil, corrupt, and they worshiped
    idols. Some of the kings even sacrificed their children to false
    **gods**.
