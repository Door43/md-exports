    of food.

Examples from the Bible stories:
--------------------------------

    When Rebekah's babies were born, the older son came out red and
    hairy, and they named him **Esau**.  **Esau** gave Jacob his rights
    as the oldest son.  When Isaac felt the goat hair and smelled the
    clothes, he thought it was **Esau** and blessed him.  **Esau**
    hated Jacob because Jacob had stolen his rights as oldest son and
    also his blessing.  But **Esau** had already forgiven Jacob, and
    they were happy to see each other again.
