Examples from the Bible stories:
--------------------------------

    After Jesus returned to heaven, the disciples stayed in Jerusalem as
    Jesus had commanded them to do. The **believers** there constantly
    gathered together to pray.  While the **believers** were all together,
    suddenly the house where they were was filled with a sound like
    a strong wind. Then something that looked like flames of fire
    appeared over the heads of all the **believers**.  Every day, more
    people became **believers**.  That day many people in Jerusalem
    started persecuting the followers of Jesus, so the **believers**
    fled to other places. But in spite of this, they preached about
    Jesus everywhere they went.  Saul was the young man who guarded the
    robes of the men who killed Stephen. He did not believe in Jesus, so
    he persecuted the **believers**.  Some **believers** who fled from
    the persecution in Jerusalem went far away to the city of Antioch
    and preached about Jesus…It was at Antioch that **believers**
    in Jesus were first called “Christians.” They also wrote many
    letters to encourage and teach the **believers** in the churches.
