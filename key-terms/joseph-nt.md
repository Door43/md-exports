Examples from the Bible stories:
--------------------------------

    She  was a virgin and was engaged to be married to a man named
    **Joseph**.  **Joseph**, the man Mary was engaged to, was a righteous
    man. When he heard that Mary was pregnant, he knew it was not his
    baby. He did not want to shame her, so he planned to quietly divorce
    her.  The angel said, “**Joseph**, do not be afraid to take Mary
    as your wife. The baby in her body is from the Holy Spirit. She
    will give birth to a son. Name him Jesus , because he will save
    the people from their sins.” **Joseph** married Mary and took
    her home as his wife, but he did not sleep with her until she had
    given birth.  **Joseph** and Mary had to make a long journey from
    where they lived in Nazareth to Bethlehem because their ancestor
    was David whose hometown was Bethlehem.  Jesus said, “The words
    I just read to you are happening right now.” All the people were
    amazed. “Isn’t this the son of **Joseph**?” they said.
