Examples from the Bible stories:
--------------------------------

    When Elizabeth was six months pregnant, the same angel appeared to
    Elizabeth’s relative, whose name was **Mary**. She was a virgin
    and was engaged to be married to a man named Joseph. The angel said,
    “You will become pregnant and give birth to a son. You are to
    name him Jesus and he will be the Messiah.” The angel explained,
    “The Holy Spirit will come to you, and the power of God will
    overshadow you. So the baby will be holy, the Son of God.”
    **Mary** believed and accepted what the angel said.  Soon after
    the angel spoke to **Mary**, she went and visited Elizabeth. As
    soon as Elizabeth heard **Mary’s** greeting, Elizabeth’s baby
    jumped inside her.  The angel said, “Joseph, do not be afraid to
    take **Mary** as your wife. The baby in her body is from the Holy
    Spirit.” Joseph and **Mary** had to make a long journey from where
    they lived in Nazareth to Bethlehem because their ancestor was David
    whose hometown was Bethlehem.  angel told a virgin named **Mary**
    that she would give birth to God’s Son. So while she was still a
    virgin, she gave birth to a son and named him Jesus.
