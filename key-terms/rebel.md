Examples from the Bible stories:

    After the Israelites had wandered in the wilderness for forty years,
    all of them who had **rebelled** against God were dead.  Ten of
    the tribes of the nation of Israel **rebelled** against Rehoboam.
    Jeroboam **rebelled** against God and caused the people to sin.
    Most of the people of Judah also **rebelled** against God and
    worshiped other gods.  But after a few years, the king of Judah
    **rebelled** against Babylon.  Then he  said, â€œYou stubborn and
    **rebellious** people always reject the Holy Spirit, just as your
    ancestors always rejected God and killed his prophets.
