descendant
==========

Definition:
-----------

A descendant is someone who is a direct blood relative of someone else
further back in history.

-   For example, Abraham was a descendant of Noah.  -   A person's
descendants would be his children, grandchildren,
    great-great-grandchildren, etc.

Examples from the Bible stories:
--------------------------------

    “The woman's **descendant** will crush your head, and you will wound
    his heel.” give the land of Canaan to your **descendants**.”
    “Your **descendants** will be more than the stars in the sky.”
    “Someone from your family will always rule as king over Israel,
    and the Messiah will be one of your **descendants**!” The kings of
    Judah were **descendants** of David.  God promised King David that the
    Messiah would be one of David's own **descendants**.  God promised
    David that the Messiah would be one of his **descendants**. Jesus,
    the Messiah, was that special **descendant** of David.
