Gibeon
======

###

Facts:
------

Gibeon was a city and a region in the land of Canaan where the Gibeonites
lived.

-   “Gibeonite” means “someone from the region called Gibeon.” -
The Gibeonites had heard about how the Israelites had destroyed
    Jericho, and they were afraid. So the Gibeonites came to the leaders
    of Israel and pretended to be people from a far-away country.
-   Israel made a treaty with the Gibeonites and did not destroy them.

Examples from the Bible stories:
--------------------------------

    But one of the Canaanite people groups, called the **Gibeonites**,
    lied to Joshua and said they were from a place far from Canaan.
    Sometime later, the kings of another people group in Canaan, the
    Amorites, heard that the **Gibeonites** had made a peace treaty
    with the Israelites, so they combined their armies into one large
    army and attacked **Gibeon**.  Joshua gathered the Israelite army
    and they marched all night to reach the **Gibeonites**.
