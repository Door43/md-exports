Definition:
-----------

To save someone or something is to rescue that person or thing from
something bad.

-   In a physical sense, people can be saved from harm, danger, or
    death.
-   In a spiritual sense, if a person has been “saved,” it means that
    through Jesus' death on the cross, God has forgiven him and rescued
    him from being punished for his sin.
-   Only God can save people from being punished for their sin.

Examples from the Bible stories:
--------------------------------

    Moses tried to **save** his fellow Israelite.  God provided a
    way to **save** the firstborn son of anyone who believed in him.
    Moses told the Israelites, “Stop being afraid! God will fight for
    you today and **save** you.” The Israelites sang many songs to
    celebrate their new freedom and to praise God because he **saved**
    them from the Egyptian army.  This pattern repeated many times:
    the Israelites would sin, God would punish them, they would repent,
    and God would send a deliverer to **save** them.  “You crucified
    Jesus, but God raised him to life again! You rejected him, but there
    is no other way to be **saved** except through the power of Jesus!”
    The jailer trembled as he came to Paul and Silas and asked, “What
    must I do to be **saved**?” Paul answered, “Believe in Jesus,
    the Master, and you and your family will be **saved**.” Good works
    cannot **save** you.  God will **save** everyone who believes in
    Jesus and receives him as their Master. But he will not **save**
    anyone who does not believe in him.
