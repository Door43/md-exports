word of God
===========

###

Definition:
-----------

The “word of God” refers to all that God has said to people. Usually
it refers to his written message, also known as the “scriptures.”

-   God used prophets, apostles, and other people to communicate the
    “word of God” to us.
-   In modern times, the “word of God” refers to the Bible.  -
Some languages will need to translate “God's word” as, “God's
    message” or, “God's book” or, “God's scroll.”
-   Jesus is also called, “the Word” and, “the Word of God.” These
    titles mean that he fully reveals who God is. He can do this because
    he is God himself.

Examples from the Bible stories:
--------------------------------

    **God’s word** he commands his people, ‘Worship only the Lord
    your God and only serve him.’” Jesus explained, “The seed is the
    **word of God**.  Then Jesus explained to them what **God’s word**
    says about the Messiah.  Jesus said, “I told you that everything
    written about me in **God’s word** must be fulfilled.” Then he
    opened their minds so they could understand **God’s word**.  Philip
    also used other **scriptures** to tell him the good news of Jesus.
    But Jesus is the greatest prophet of all. He is the **Word of God**.
    God tells you to pray, to study his **word**, to worship him with
    other Christians, and to tell others what he has done for you.
