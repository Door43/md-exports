holy
====

Definition:
-----------

To be holy is to be separated from all sin and evil. Only God is
absolutely holy. But he can make things and people holy.

-   A holy person or thing is morally perfect, completely without sin.
-   People and things that God sets apart for a special purpose are
    called holy, such as a priest who must be ceremonially cleansed of
    sin in order to serve God, or a place where God reveals himself,
    such as, “holy ground” or his temple.

Make sure that the translation of the word “holy” does not mean
something that is taboo or forbidden.

Examples from the Bible stories:
--------------------------------

     blessed the seventh day and made it **holy**, because on this
    day he rested from his work.  “You are standing on **holy**
    ground.” “If you will obey me and keep my covenant, you will be
    my prized possession, a kingdom of priests, and a **holy** nation.”
    “Always be sure to keep the Sabbath day **holy**.” “So the baby
    will be **holy**, the Son of God.” we wait for Jesus to return,
    God wants us to live in a way that is **holy** and that honors him.
