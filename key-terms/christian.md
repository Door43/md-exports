Christian
=========

Definition:
-----------

After Jesus went back to heaven, people started calling his followers
“Christians” because they were followers of Christ, which is another
word for “Messiah.”

-   A Christian is a person who follows Jesus. He believes that Jesus is
    the Son of God, and he trusts Jesus to save him from his sins.
-   People sometimes use the word “Christian” to refer to someone who
    just believes that the Christian religion is a good religion. This
    is not the meaning of “Christian” in the Bible.
-   In the Bible, “Christian” always refers to someone who truly
    believes in Jesus. For that reason, “Christians” are often
    called “believers.”
-   Be careful to translate this term with a word that can refer to
    everyone who believes in Jesus, not just certain groups.

Examples from the Bible stories:
--------------------------------

    was at Antioch that believers in Jesus were first called
    “**Christians**.” Paul and other **Christian** leaders traveled
    to many cities, preaching and teaching people the good news about
    Jesus.  you believe in Jesus and what he has done for you, you are a
    **Christian**!  you are a **Christian**, God has forgiven your sins
    because of what Jesus did.  Even though you are a **Christian**,
    you will still be tempted to sin.  Before he returned to heaven,
    Jesus told **Christians** to proclaim the good news to people who
    have never heard it.  When Jesus returns, every **Christian** who
    has died will rise from the dead and meet him in the sky.
