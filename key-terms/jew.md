Examples from the Bible stories:
--------------------------------

    The Israelites were now called **Jews** and most of them had lived
    their whole lives in Babylon.  So, after seventy years in exile, a
    small group of **Jews** returned to the city of Jerusalem in Judah.
    Many of the **Jews** believed in Jesus because of this miracle.
    But the religious leaders of the **Jews** were jealous, so they
    gathered together to plan how they could kill Jesus and Lazarus.
    Pilate commanded that they write, “King of the **Jews**” on
    a sign and put it on the cross above Jesus’ head.  Right away,
    Saul began preaching to the **Jews** in Damascus, saying, “Jesus
    is the Son of God!”
