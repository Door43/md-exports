Examples from the Bible stories:
--------------------------------

    When people heard John's message, many of them repented from their
    sins, and John **baptized** them. Many religious leaders also came
    to be **baptized** by John, but they did not repent or confess
    their sins.  The next day, Jesus came to be **baptized** by John.
    John said to Jesus, “I am not worthy to **baptize** you. You
    should **baptize** me instead.” go, make disciples of all people
    groups by **baptizing** them in the name of the Father, the Son,
    and the Holy Spirit and by teaching them to obey everything I have
    commanded you.” Peter answered them, “Every one of you should
    repent and be **baptized** in the name of Jesus Christ so that God
    will forgive your sins.” About 3,000 people believed what Peter
    said and became disciples of Jesus. They were **baptized** and became
    part of the church at Jerusalem.  Philip and the Ethiopian traveled,
    they came to some water. The Ethiopian said, “Look! There is some
    water! May I be **baptized**?” Saul immediately was able to see
    again, and Ananias **baptized** him.  Jesus invites you to believe
    in him and be **baptized**.
