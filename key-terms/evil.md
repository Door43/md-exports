Evil is any action, thought or character that is opposed to God's holy
character and will.

-   Evil people and evil behaviors can also be described as bad, wicked
    or immoral. The words “evil” and “wicked” often have a very
    similar meaning.
-   The results of evil are clearly shown in how people mistreat others
    by killing, stealing, slandering or being cruel and unkind.
-   An evil spirit is a being that rebels against God.

“Evil” is the opposite of “good,” and “wicked” is the opposite
of “righteous.”

Examples from the Bible stories:
--------------------------------

    “God just knows that as soon as you eat it, you will be like God and
    will understand good and **evil** like he does.” After a long time,
    many people were living in the world. They had become very **wicked**
    and violent.  But Noah found favor with God. He was a righteous man
    living among **wicked** people.  God saw that if they all kept working
    together to do **evil**, they could do many more sinful things.
    “You tried to do **evil** when you sold me as a slave, but God used
    the **evil** for good!” They  worshiped false gods and did many
    **evil** things.  But then he  became a **wicked** man who did not
    obey God, so God chose a different man who would one day be king in
    his place.  the new kingdom of Israel, all the kings were **evil**.
    The king was so angry that he threw the **wicked** servant into
    prison until he could pay back all of his debt.  They said, “We
    heard him  speak **evil** things about Moses and God!”
     will wipe away every tear and there will be no more
    suffering, sadness, crying, **evil**, pain, or death.
