Definition:
-----------

To betray someone is to gain that person's trust, but then to act in a
way that deceives that person or is harmful to him in some way.

-   Judas was “the betrayer” because he told the Jewish leaders how to
    capture Jesus.
-   The betrayal by Judas was especially evil because Judas was an
    apostle of Jesus, because Judas betrayed Jesus for money, and because
    the betrayal ended with the unjust execution of Jesus.

Examples from the Bible stories:
--------------------------------

    Other prophets foretold that those who killed the Messiah would
    gamble for his clothes and he would be **betrayed** by a friend. The
    prophet Zechariah foretold that the friend would be paid thirty silver
    coins as payment for **betraying** the Messiah.  After Jesus and the
    disciples arrived in Jerusalem, Judas went to the Jewish leaders and
    offered to **betray** Jesus to them in exchange for money.  The Jewish
    leaders, led by the high priest, paid Judas thirty silver coins to
    **betray** Jesus.  Then Jesus said to the disciples, “One of you
    will **betray** me.” … Jesus said, “The person to whom I give
    this piece of bread is the **betrayer**.” When he returned the third
    time, Jesus said, “Wake up! My **betrayer** is here.” Then Jesus
    said, “Judas, do you **betray** me with a kiss?” Meanwhile, Judas,
    the **betrayer**, saw that the Jewish leaders had condemned Jesus
    to die. He became full of sorrow and went away and killed himself.
