Examples from the Bible stories:
--------------------------------

    Early the next morning, the Jewish leaders brought Jesus to
    **Pilate**, the Roman governor. They hoped that **Pilate** would
    condemn Jesus as guilty and sentenced him to be killed. **Pilate**
    asked Jesus, “Are you the King of the Jews?” **Pilate** said,
    “What is truth?” After speaking with Jesus, **Pilate** went out
    to the crowd and said, “I find no guilt in this man.” But the
    Jewish leaders and the crowd shouted, “Crucify him!” **Pilate**
    replied, “He is not guilty.” But they shouted even louder. Then
    **Pilate** said a third time, “He is not guilty!” **Pilate**
    became afraid that the crowd would begin to riot, so he ordered his
    soldiers to crucify Jesus.  **Pilate** commanded that a sign be put
    above Jesus’ head that read, “King of the Jews.” **Pilate**
    said, “Take some soldiers and make the tomb as secure as you can.”
