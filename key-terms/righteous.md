righteous
=========

Definition:
-----------

The word “righteous” means morally good and without fault. A righteous
person does what is right, good, and proper. However, no one except God
is completely righteous.

-   Righteous people obey God and live in a way that pleases him.  -
God judges people as righteous when they trust in Jesus to save them
    and cleanse them from their sins.
-   Jesus lived a completely righteous life on earth. When people trust
    in him and follow him in obedience, God gives them Jesus'
    righteousness.

“Righteous” is the opposite of “wicked.”

Examples from the Bible stories:
--------------------------------

    But Noah found favor with God. He was a **righteous** man, living
    among wicked people.  God declared that Abram was **righteous**
    because he believed in God's promise.  David was a humble and
    **righteous** man who trusted and obeyed God.  Joseph, the man Mary
    was engaged to, was a **righteous** man.  Then the **righteous**
    ones will shine like the sun in the kingdom of God their Father.”
