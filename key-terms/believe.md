Definition:
-----------

“Believe” can have two related but different senses:

#### 1. Believe

-   To believe something is to accept or trust that it is true.  -
To believe someone is to acknowledge that what that person has said
    is true.

#### 2. Believe in

-   To believe in someone is to trust that that person is reliable. In
    other words, it is to trust that the person is who he says he is,
    that he always speaks the truth, and that he will do what he has
    promised to do.
-   To believe in an idea or principle is to be sure that that idea or
    principle is the right way to act or live. For example, a person
    might believe in honesty, and therefore always tell the truth.
-   When a person truly believes in something, the person will act in
    such a way that shows that belief.

Examples from the Bible stories:
--------------------------------

    Noah warned the people about the coming flood and told them to turn
    to God, but they did not **believe** him.  Abram **believed** God's
    promise. God declared that Abram was righteous because he **believed**
    God's promise.  God provided a way to save the firstborn of anyone
    who **believed in** him.  But the Egyptians did not **believe**
    God or obey his commands.  Jesus replied, “I am the Resurrection
    and the Life. Whoever **believes in** me will live, even though
    he dies. Everyone who **believes in** me will never die. Do you
    **believe** this?”
