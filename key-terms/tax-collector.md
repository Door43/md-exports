tax collector
=============

Definition:
-----------

The job of tax collectors was to receive the money that people owed the
government and to deliver it to the government.

-   In the time of Jesus and and the apostles, the Roman government
    required taxes from the Jews.
-   The people who collected taxes for the Roman government would often
    demand more money from the people than the government required. The
    tax collectors would keep the extra amount for themselves.
-   The Jews considered tax collectors to be some of the worst sinners
    because they cheated people, and because they worked for the foreign
    Roman government. This made the tax collectors traitors to their
    own people.

Examples from the Bible stories:
--------------------------------

    said, “Two men went to the Temple to pray. One of them was a **tax
    collector**, and the other was a religious leader.” “The religious
    leader prayed like this, ‘Thank you, God, that I am not a sinner
    like other men—such as robbers, unjust men, adulterers, or even
    like that **tax collector**.’” “But the **tax collector**
    stood far away from the religious ruler, did not even look up to
    heaven. Instead, he pounded on his chest and prayed, ‘God, please
    be merciful to me because I am a sinner.’” Then Jesus said, “I
    tell you the truth, God heard the **tax collector’s** prayer and
    declared him to be righteous.” One day, Jesus was teaching many
    **tax collectors** and other sinners who had gathered to hear him.
