lamb

###

Definition:
-----------

In the Bible, a lamb is a young sheep or goat. A sheep is a four-legged
animal with a thick woolly hair. People raise them for their wool or
as a source of food. Sheep are defenseless and timid. Goats are similar
animals, and are used mainly for food.

-   God's people used to sacrifice sheep and lambs to Him. The ones they
    sacrificed had to be physically perfect, with no defects.
-   Jesus is called the “Lamb of God” because he was morally
    perfect–completely without sin–and his sacrifice paid for
    people's sins.

Examples from the Bible stories:
--------------------------------

    Abraham and Isaac walked to the place of the sacrifice Isaac
    asked, “Father, we have wood for the sacrifice, but where is the
    **lamb**?” God provided a way to save the firstborn son of anyone
    who believed in him. Each family had to choose a perfect **lamb**
    or goat and kill it.  The next day, Jesus came to be baptized by
    John. When John saw him, he said, “Look! There is the **Lamb of
    God** who will take away the sin of the world.” read, “They
    led him like a **lamb** to be killed, and as a **lamb** is silent,
    he did not say a word.  When God told Abraham to offer his son,
    Isaac, as a sacrifice, God provided a **lamb** for the sacrifice
    instead of his son, Isaac. We all deserve to die for our sins! But
    God provided Jesus, the **Lamb** of God, as a sacrifice to die in
    our place.  When God sent the last plague on Egypt, he told each
    Israelite family to kill a perfect **lamb** and spread its blood
    around the tops and sides of their door frames.
