Examples from the Bible stories:
--------------------------------

    About 100 years after the Assyrians destroyed the kingdom of
    Israel, God sent **Nebuchadnezzar**, king of the Babylonians,
    to attack the kingdom of Judah.  The king of Judah agreed to be
    **Nebuchadnezzar’s** servant and pay him a lot of money every year.
    punish the king of Judah for rebelling, **Nebuchadnezzar's** soldiers
    killed the king’s sons in front of him and then made him blind.
    **Nebuchadnezzar** and his army took almost all of the people of the
    kingdom of Judah to Babylon, leaving only the poorest people behind
    to plant the fields.
