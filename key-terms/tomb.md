tomb

###

Definition:
-----------

A tomb is a place where people put the bodies of those who die.

-   The Jews sometimes used natural caves as tombs, and sometimes they
    dug caves out of the rock on the side of a hill.
-   When Jesus was living, it was common to roll a large, heavy, round
    stone in front of the opening of a tomb in order to close it.
-   This can also be translated as, “grave.” But if your word
for grave
    can only refer to a hole dug down into the ground so that the body is
    placed below the ground, then it might be better to translate it as,
    “cave” or, “hole in a hill.”

Examples from the Bible stories:
--------------------------------

    The man lived among the **tombs** in the area.  Jesus asked
    them, “Where have you put Lazarus?” They told him, “In the
    **tomb**. Come and see.” The **tomb** was a cave with a stone
    rolled in front of its opening.  Then Joseph and Nicodemus, two
    Jewish leaders who believed Jesus was the Messiah, asked Pilate for
    Jesus’ body. They wrapped his body in cloth and placed it in a
    **tomb** cut out of rock. Then they rolled a large stone in front
    the **tomb** to block the opening.
     rolled away the stone that was covering the entrance to
    the **tomb** and sat on it. The soldiers guarding the **tomb**
    were terrified and fell to the ground like dead men.  When the
    women arrived at the **tomb**, the angel told them, “Do not be
    afraid. Jesus is not here. He has risen from the dead, just like he
    said he would! Look in the **tomb** and see.” The women looked
    into the **tomb** and saw where Jesus’ body had been laid. His
    body was not there!
