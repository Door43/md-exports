Examples from the Bible stories:
--------------------------------

    David ruled with **justice** and faithfulness for many years, and God
    blessed him.  Some of these kings  were good men who ruled **justly**
    and worshiped God.  They  all told the people to stop worshiping idols
    and to start showing **justice** and mercy to others.  Jesus will
    rule his kingdom with peace and **justice**, and he will be with
    his people forever.
