Facts:
------

Paul was a leader of the early church who was sent by Jesus to take the
good news to many other people groups.

-   Paul was a Jew who was born in the Roman city of Tarsus, and was
    therefore also a Roman citizen.
-   Paul was originally called by his Jewish name, Saul.  -   Saul became
a Jewish religious leader and arrested Jews who became
    Christians because he did not believe in Jesus.
-   Jesus came to Saul in a blinding light and told him to stop hurting
    Christians. Jesus then sent a Christian man to teach Saul, and Saul
    believed in Jesus.
-   At first, Saul taught Jews about Jesus.  -   Later, God sent Saul
to teach other people groups about Jesus in
    many Roman cities. Then he started using the Roman name, Paul.
-   Paul also wrote letters to encourage and teach Christians in various
    cities. Some of his letters are in the Bible.

Examples from the Bible stories:
--------------------------------

    young man named **Saul** agreed with the people who killed Stephen and
    guarded their robes while they threw stones at him.  **Saul** was the
    young man who guarded the robes of the men who killed Stephen. He did
    not believe in Jesus, so he persecuted the believers.  While **Saul**
    was on his way to Damascus, a bright light from heaven shone all
    around him, and he fell to the ground. **Saul** heard someone say,
    “**Saul**! **Saul**! Why do you persecute me?” Ananias went to
    **Saul**, placed his hands on him, and said, “Jesus who appeared
    to you on your way here, sent me to you so that you can regain your
    sight and be filled with the Holy Spirit.” **Saul** immediately was
    able to see again, and Ananias baptized him.  Right away, **Saul**
    began preaching to the Jews in Damascus, saying, “Jesus is the
    Son of God!” Barnabas and **Saul** went there  to teach these new
    believers more about Jesus and to strengthen the church.  **Saul**
    traveled throughout the Roman Empire, he began to use his Roman name,
    “**Paul**.” **Paul** and other Christian leaders traveled to
    many cities, preaching and teaching people the good news about Jesus.
