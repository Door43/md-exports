Judah and Benjamin.

of the kings of the kingdom of Judah obeyed God and led the
    people to worship him. But many of Judah's kings were evil.
-   Over 120 years after Assyria defeated Israel ,
    Judah was conquered by the nation of Babylon. The Babylonians
    destroyed the city and the Temple, and took most of the people from
    the kingdom of Judah away to Babylon as captives.
