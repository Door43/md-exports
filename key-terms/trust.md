Definition:
-----------

To trust someone or something is to believe that they are reliable,
honest, true, and dependable.

-   Trust is closely related to faith. We trust someone because we have
    faith that they will do what they promised to do.
-   Trusting in Jesus means believing that he is God, believing that his
    sacrificial death on the cross paid for our sins, and depending on
    him to save us.
-   Often people foolishly trust in themselves, other people, or things
    to meet their needs, even though these cannot bring them the good
    that they desire.

Examples from the Bible stories:
--------------------------------

    When the Israelites saw that the Egyptians were dead, they **trusted**
    in God and believed that Moses was a prophet of God.  Joshua was
    a good leader because he **trusted** and obeyed God.  David was a
    humble and righteous man who **trusted** and obeyed God.  Then Jesus
    told a story about people who **trusted** in their own good deeds
    and despised other people.
