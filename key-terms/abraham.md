Examples from the Bible stories:
--------------------------------

    When **Abram** arrived in Canaan, God said, “Look all around you. I
    will give to you and your descendants all the land that you can see as
    an inheritance.” Then God changed **Abram**'s name to **Abraham**,
    which means “father of many.” About a year later, when **Abraham**
    was 100 years old and Sarah was 90, Sarah gave birth to Abraham's son.
    When Isaac was a young man, God tested **Abraham's** faith by saying,
    “Take Isaac, your only son, and kill him as a sacrifice to me.”
    When **Abraham** was very old and his son, Isaac, had grown to be a
    man, **Abraham** sent one of his servants back to the land where his
    relatives lived to find a wife for his son, Isaac.  After a long time,
    **Abraham** died and all of the promises that God had made to him in
    the covenant were passed on to Isaac.  God promised **Abraham** that
    through him all people groups of the world would receive a blessing.
