suffer
======

###

Definition:
-----------

To suffer is to experience something very unpleasant, such as illness,
pain, or great hardship.

-   Suffering is often necessary to accomplish a specific purpose.  -
Some suffering is involuntary–it happens to us outside of our
    control.
-   People can also choose to suffer for a reason, such as when the
    Messiah decided to suffer in order to pay for our sins.

Examples from the Bible stories:
--------------------------------

    God said, “I have seen the **suffering** of my people.” Jesus
    prayed three times, “My Father, if it is possible, please let me
    not have to drink this cup of **suffering**.”
     reminded them that the prophets said the Messiah would
    **suffer** and be killed, but would rise again on the third day.
     said, “It was written long ago that the Messiah would
    **suffer**, die, and rise from the dead on the third day.”
    “Although you did not understand what you were doing, God used your
    actions to fulfill the prophecies that the Messiah would **suffer**
    and die.” God said, “I have chosen him  to declare my name to the
    unsaved. I will show him how much he must **suffer** for my sake.”
     will wipe away every tear and there will be no more
    **suffering**, sadness, crying, evil, pain, or death.
