Examples from the Bible stories:
--------------------------------

    One of the miracles happened to Naaman, an enemy commander, who had
    a horrible skin disease. He had heard of Elisha so he went and asked
    Elisha to **heal** him.
     also predicted that the Messiah would **heal** sick people
    and those who could not hear, see, speak, or walk.  Jesus continued
    saying, “And during the time of the prophet Elisha, there were many
    people in Israel with skin diseases. But Elisha did not **heal** any
    of them. He only **healed** the skin disease of Naaman, a commander
    of Israel’s enemies.” They brought many people who were sick or
    handicapped, including those who could not see, walk, hear, or speak,
    and Jesus **healed** them.  She had heard that Jesus had **healed**
    many sick people and thought, “I'm sure that if I can just touch
    Jesus’ clothes, then I will be **healed**, too!” Immediately,
    God **healed** the lame man, and he began to walk and jump around,
    and to praise God.  Peter answered them, “This man stands before
    you **healed** by the power of Jesus the Messiah.” Jesus did many
    miracles that prove he is God. He walked on water, calmed storms,
    **healed** many sick people, drove out demons, raised the dead to
    life, and turned five loaves of bread and two small fish into enough
    food for over 5,000 people.
