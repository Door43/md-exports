Mercy is coming to the aid of those in need, especially when they are
in a lowly or humbled condition.

-   We show mercy when we help someone who is in great need.  -   We
show mercy when we have the power to harm someone, but treat him
    kindly instead.
-   We show mercy when we forgive someone who has done us wrong.  -
God is merciful to us, and he wants us to be merciful to others.

Examples from the Bible stories:
--------------------------------

    They  all told the people to stop worshiping idols and to start
    showing justice and **mercy** to others.
     sank down into the mud that was in the bottom of the
    well, but then the king had **mercy** on him and ordered his servants
    to pull Jeremiah out of the well before he died.  The Persian Empire
    was strong but **merciful** to the people it conquered.  Then Jesus
    asked the law expert, “What do you think? Which one of the three men
    was a neighbor to the man who was robbed and beaten?” He replied,
    “The one who was **merciful** to him.” But Jesus said to him,
    “No, I want you to go home and tell your friends and family about
    everything that God has done for you and how he has had **mercy** on
    you.” “But the tax collector stood far away from the religious
    ruler, did not even look up to heaven. Instead, he pounded on his
    chest and prayed, ‘God, please be **merciful** to me because I am
    a sinner.’”
