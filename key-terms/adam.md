Adam
====

Facts:
------

Adam was made in the image of God. God made Adam with many qualities that
God has in himself, like personality, the ability to love, the capacity
to make choices, to be self-aware, and to be capable of relationships
and to communicate, plus many more.

-   Adam was the first man.  -   God formed him from dirt and breathed
life into him.  -   Adam's name sounds similar to the Hebrew word for
“red dirt” or
    “ground.”
-   The name “Adam” is the same as the Old Testament word for
“mankind”
    or “human being.”
-   All people are descendants of Adam and Eve.

Adam and Eve disobeyed God. They did what God told them not to do. This
separated them from God and brought spiritual and physical death into
their lives and into the world that God had made.

Examples from the Bible stories:
--------------------------------

    Then God said, “Let us make human beings in our image to be like
    us.” This man's name was **Adam**. God planted a garden where
    **Adam** could live, and put him there to care for it.  Then God
    said, “It is not good for man to be alone.” But none of the
    animals could be **Adam's** helper.  And God clothed **Adam** and
    Eve with animal skins.  God sent **Adam** and Eve away from the
    beautiful garden.  When **Adam** and Eve sinned, it affected all
    of their descendants.  Because **Adam** and Eve disobeyed God and
    brought sin into this world, God cursed it and decided to destroy it.
