Examples from the Bible stories:
--------------------------------

    Suddenly, the skies were filled with angels praising God, saying,
    “**Glory** to God in heaven and peace on earth to the people he
    favors!” Then Satan showed Jesus all the kingdoms of the world
    and all their **glory** and said, “I will give you all this if
    you bow down and worship me.” When Jesus heard this news, he said,
    “This sickness will not end in death, but it is for the **glory**
    of God.” Jesus responded, “Did I not tell you that you would
    see God’s **glory** if you believe in me?”
