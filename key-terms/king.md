Examples from the Bible stories:
--------------------------------

    One night, the Pharaoh, which is what the Egyptians called their
    kings, had two dreams that disturbed him greatly.  The Israelites had
    no **king**, so everyone did what they thought was right for them.
    Finally, the people asked God for a **king** like all the other
    nations had.  Eventually, Saul died in battle, and David became
    **king** of Israel. He was a good **king**, and the people loved him.
    God's prophets also said that the Messiah would be a prophet,
    a priest, and a **king**.  David was the **king** of Israel, but
    Jesus is the **king** of the entire universe!
