kingdom of Israel
=================

Facts:
------

After King Solomon died, the Israelites split into two kingdoms. The
kingdom of Israel was the northern kingdom, composed of ten of the tribes
of Israel.

-   All of the kings of the kingdom of Israel were evil. They convinced
    the people to stop worshiping God at the Temple in Jerusalem, and
    to serve idols and false gods instead. So God eventually sent the
    Assyrians to attack them and to take many of them away as captives.
-   The Assyrians brought foreigners to live with the few remaining
    people of the kingdom of Israel. These foreigners intermarried with
    the Israelites, and their descendants became the Samaritan people.

Examples from the Bible stories:
--------------------------------

    The other ten tribes of the nation of Israel that rebelled against
    Rehoboam appointed a man named Jeroboam to be their king. They set up
    their kingdom in the northern part of the land and were called the
    **kingdom of Israel**.  The **kingdoms of Judah and Israel** became
    enemies and often fought against each other.  the new **kingdom
    of Israel**, all the kings were evil.  The **kingdoms of Israel**
    and Judah both sinned against God.  The **kingdom of Israel** was
    destroyed by the Assyrian Empire, a powerful, cruel nation. The
    Assyrians killed many people in the **kingdom of Israel**, took
    away everything of value, and burned much of the country.  Then the
    Assyrians brought foreigners to live in the land where the **kingdom
    of Israel** had been. The foreigners rebuilt the destroyed cities
    and married the Israelites who were left there. The descendants of
    the Israelites who married foreigners were called Samaritans.
