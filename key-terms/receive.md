    them and to treat them with honor in order to build a relationship
    with them.
-   To “receive the gift of the Holy Spirit” means we welcome the Holy
    Spirit into our lives, and allow him to work in and through us.

Examples from the Bible stories:
--------------------------------

    The prophets also said that the Messiah would be perfect, having no
    sin. He would die to **receive** the punishment for other people’s
    sin. His punishment would bring peace between God and people.
    Stephen was dying, he cried out, “Jesus, **receive** my spirit.”
     taught that some people will receive him and be saved, but
    other will not.  When Jesus died on the cross, he **received**
    your punishment.  God will save everyone who believes in Jesus and
    **receives** him as their Master.
