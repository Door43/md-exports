Definition:
-----------

To pray is to talk to God.

-   People often pray to God to ask him to help them or other people.
-   People also thank and praise God in their prayers.  -   Praying can
also mean confessing our sins to God and asking him to
    forgive us.
-   When people try to talk to their false god, this is also called
    “praying.”

Examples from the Bible stories:
--------------------------------

    Isaac **prayed** for Rebekah, and God allowed her to get pregnant
    with twins.  But Moses **prayed** for them, and God listened to
    his **prayer** and did not destroy them.  Then the prophets of Baal
    **prayed** to Baal, “Hear us, O Baal!” Priests also **prayed**
    to God for the people.  Jesus told his disciples to **pray** that
    they would not enter into temptation.  The disciples continually
    listened to the teaching of the apostles, spent time together,
    ate together, and **prayed** with each other.  God tells you to
    **pray**, to study his word, to worship him with other Christians,
    and to tell others what he has done for you.
