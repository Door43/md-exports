Examples from the Bible stories:
--------------------------------

    Many people who had **demons in them** were brought to Jesus.
    When they reached the other side of the lake, a **demon-possessed**
    man came running up to Jesus.  The man **with the demon** cried out
    in a loud voice, “What do you want with me, Jesus, Son of the Most
    High God? Please do not torture me!” The people from the town came
    and saw the man who used to **have the demons**.  Every day as they
    walked there, a slave girl **possessed by a demon** followed them.
