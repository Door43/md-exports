Examples from the Bible stories:
--------------------------------

    After two years, Joseph was still in prison, even though he was
    **innocent**.  One of them mocked Jesus, but the other said, “Do you
    have no fear of God? We are guilty, but this man is **innocent**.”
    When the soldier guarding Jesus saw everything that happened, he said,
    “Certainly, this man was **innocent**. He was the Son of God.”
