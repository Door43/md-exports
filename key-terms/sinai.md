Examples from the Bible stories:
--------------------------------

    After God led the Israelites through the Red Sea, he led them through
    the wilderness to a mountain called **Sinai**.  Three days later,
    after the people had prepared themselves spiritually, God came
    down on top of **Mount Sinai** with thunder, lightning, smoke, and
    a loud trumpet blast.  For many days, Moses was on top of **Mount
    Sinai** talking with God.  Then Joshua reminded the people of their
    obligation to obey the covenant that God had made with the Israelites
    at **Sinai**.
