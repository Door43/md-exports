Examples from the Bible stories:
--------------------------------

    Some time later, wise men from countries far to the east saw an
    unusual star in the sky. They realized it meant a new **king of the
    Jews** was born.  Pilate asked Jesus, “Are you the **King of the
    Jews**?” The Roman soldiers whipped Jesus and put a royal robe
    and a crown made of thorns on him. Then they mocked him by saying,
    “Look, the **King of the Jews**!” Pilate commanded that they
    write, “**King of the Jews**” on a sign and put it on the cross
    above Jesus’ head.
