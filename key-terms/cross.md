Examples from the Bible stories:
--------------------------------

    After the soldiers mocked Jesus, they led him away to crucify him.
    They made him carry the **cross** on which he would die.  The soldiers
    brought Jesus to a place called “the Skull” and nailed his arms
    and feet to the **cross**.  The Jewish leaders and the other people
    in the crowd mocked Jesus.  They said to him, “If you are the
    Son of God, come down from the **cross** and save yourself! Then we
    will believe you.” When Jesus died on the **cross**, he received
    your punishment.  You must believe that Jesus is the Son of God,
    that he died on the **cross** instead of you, and that God raised
    him to life again.
