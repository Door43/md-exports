Definition:
-----------

An idol is an object that people make so they can worship it.

-   People make idols to represent the gods that they worship.  -
These false gods do not exist–there is no God besides Yahweh.
    Therefore the idols have no power.
-   Sometimes things happen by coincidence that make idols seem to have
    power. Sometimes demons work through idols in order to deceive people.
-   Idols are often made of precious materials like gold or silver.

Examples from the Bible stories:
--------------------------------

    “Do not make **idols** or worship them, because I, Yahweh, am
    a jealous God.” Aaron made a golden **idol** in the shape of a
    calf. The people began to wildly worship the **idol** and make
    sacrifices to it!  “You must completely destroy all of their
    **idols**. If you do not obey me, you will worship their **idols**
    instead of me.” All of the kings and most of the people of the
    kingdom of Israel worshiped **idols**. This kind of worship often
    included sexual immorality and sometimes even child sacrifice.
    They  all told the people to stop worshiping **idols** and to start
    showing justice and mercy to others.
