sacrifice
=========

###

Definition:
-----------

A sacrifice is an offering to God of something valuable as a form
of worship.

-   The Israelites made several different kinds of sacrifices. These
    included sacrifices to ask God to forgive sin and sacrifices to
    thank him for blessings.
-   Most sacrifices involved killing an animal and offering it to God as
    a gift.

Animal sacrifices could never truly make a person clean from his sin.
Only the sacrifice of Jesus, God's perfect, sinless Son, can cleanse
people from sin.

Examples from the Bible stories:
--------------------------------

    After Noah got off the boat, he built an altar and **sacrificed**
    some of each kind of animal which could be used for a **sacrifice**.
    God was happy with the **sacrifice** and blessed Noah and his family.
    “Take Isaac, your only son, and kill him as a **sacrifice**
    to me.” Again Abraham obeyed God and prepared to **sacrifice**
    his son.  God had provided the ram to be the **sacrifice** instead
    of Isaac.  Anyone who disobeyed God's law could bring an animal to
    the Tent of Meeting as a **sacrifice** to God. A priest would kill
    the animal and burn it on the altar. The blood of the animal that
    was **sacrificed** covered the person's sin and made that person
    clean in God's sight.  David wanted to build a temple where all the
    Israelites could worship God and offer him **sacrifices**.  Jesus is
    the Great High Priest. Unlike other priests, he offered himself as
    the only **sacrifice** that could to take away the sin of all the
    people in the world.  But God provided Jesus, the Lamb of God, as
    a **sacrifice** to die in our place.  Because Jesus **sacrificed**
    himself, God can forgive any sin, even terrible sins.
