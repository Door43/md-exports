Examples from the Bible stories:
--------------------------------

    God said, “I AM WHO I AM. Tell them, ‘I AM has sent me to you.’
    Also tell them, ‘I am **Yahweh**, the God of your ancestors Abraham,
    Isaac, and Jacob. This is my name forever.’” Then God gave them
    the covenant and said, “I am **Yahweh**, your God, who saved you
    from slavery in Egypt. Do not worship other gods.” “Do not make
    idols or worship them, for I, **Yahweh**, am a jealous God.” The
    Israelites began to worship the Canaanite gods instead of **Yahweh**,
    the true God.  Then Elijah prayed, “O **Yahweh**, God of Abraham,
    Isaac, and Jacob, show us today that you are the God of Israel and
    that I am your servant.”
