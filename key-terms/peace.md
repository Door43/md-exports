    God had commanded the Israelites not to make a **peace** treaty with
    any of the people groups in Canaan.  Then God gave Israel **peace**
    along all its borders.  Then God provided a deliverer who rescued
    them from their enemies and brought **peace** to the land.
     would die to receive the punishment for other peopleâ€™s
    sin. His punishment would bring **peace** between God and people.
    David was the king of Israel, but Jesus is the king of the entire
    universe! He will come again and rule his kingdom with justice and
    **peace**, forever.  Jesus will rule his kingdom with **peace**
    and justice, and he will be with his people forever.
