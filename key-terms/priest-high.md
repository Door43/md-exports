Examples from the Bible stories:
--------------------------------

    one could enter the room behind the curtain except the **high
    priest**, because God lived there.  The Messiah who would come would
    be the perfect **high priest** who would offer himself as a perfect
    sacrifice to God.  The Jewish leaders, led by the **high priest**,
    paid Judas thirty silver coins to betray Jesus.  The soldiers led
    Jesus to the house of the **high priest** in order for the **high
    priest** to question him.  Finally, the **high priest** looked
    directly at Jesus and said, “Tell us, are you the Messiah, the Son
    of the living God?” The next day, the Jewish leaders brought Peter
    and John to the **high priest** and the other religious leaders.
    the religious leaders arrested Stephen and brought him to the **high
    priest** and the other leaders of the Jews, where more false witnesses
    lied about Stephen.  The **high priest** gave Saul permission to go
    to the city of Damascus to arrest Christians there and bring them
    back to Jerusalem.  Jesus is the Great **High Priest**. Unlike other
    priests, he offered himself as the only sacrifice that could to take
    away the sin of all the people in the world. Jesus was the perfect
    **high priest** because he took the punishment for every sin that
    anyone has ever committed.
