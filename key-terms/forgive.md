To forgive someone means to not resent that person and not be angry at
him for doing something hurtful.

-   Forgiving someone often means not punishing that person for
    something he has done wrong.
-   This can also mean not making someone pay back money he owes, as in
    “forgiving a debt.”
-   Forgiveness is the act of forgiving.  -   When people confess their
sins, God forgives them based on Jesus'
    sacrificial death on the cross.
-   Jesus taught his disciples to forgive others as he has forgiven
    them.

Examples from the Bible stories:
--------------------------------

    But Esau had already **forgiven** Jacob, and they were happy to see
    each other again.  Then Moses climbed the mountain again and prayed
    that God would **forgive** the people. God listened to Moses and
    **forgave** them.  David repented of his sin and God **forgave** him.
    the New Covenant, God would write his law on the people's hearts,
    the people would know God personally, they would be his people,
    and God would **forgive** their sins.  One day Peter asked Jesus,
    “Master, how many times should I **forgive** my brother when he
    sins against me?” **forgave** your debt because you begged me.
    Then Jesus took a cup and said, “Drink this. It is my blood of
    the New Covenant that is poured out for the **forgiveness** of sins.
