Examples from the Bible stories:
--------------------------------

    God said to the man, “You listened to your wife and **disobeyed**
    me.” the people obeyed these laws, God promised that he would bless
    and protect them. If they **disobeyed** them, God would punish them.
    Because the Israelites kept **disobeying** God, he punished them by
    allowing their enemies to defeat them.  “The older son said to his
    father, ‘All these years I have worked faithfully for you! I never
    **disobeyed** you, and still you did not give me one small goat so
    I could celebrate with my friends.'”
