Isaac
=====

Facts:
------

Isaac was the son that God promised to give Abraham and Sarah even though
they were very old.

-   God promised that the covenant that he had made with Abraham would
    extend to Isaac and to all of Isaac's descendants forever.
-   God tested Abraham's faith by telling him to sacrifice Isaac.  -
Isaac's son Jacob had twelve sons. Their descendants later became
    the twelve tribes of the nation of Israel.
-   Isaac means “he laughs.” When God told Abraham that he and Sarah
    would have a child, he laughed because they were both very old.

Examples from the Bible stories:
--------------------------------

    “Your wife, Sarai, will have a son—he will be the son of promise.
    Name him **Isaac**.” When **Isaac** was a young man, God tested
    Abraham's faith by saying, “Take **Isaac**, your only son, and
    kill him as a sacrifice to me.” God had provided the ram to be
    the sacrifice instead of **Isaac**.  When Abraham was very old and
    his son, **Isaac**, had grown to be a man, Abraham sent one of his
    servants back to the land where his relatives lived to find a wife
    for his son, **Isaac.** **Isaac** prayed for Rebekah, and God allowed
    her to get pregnant with twins.  Then **Isaac** died, and Jacob and
    Esau buried him. The covenant promises God had promised to Abraham
    and then to **Isaac** now passed on to Jacob.
