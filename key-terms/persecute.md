persecute
=========

###

Definition:
-----------

To persecute someone is to repeatedly attack him or to treat him cruelly.

-   It is possible to persecute a single person, a small group of
    people, or even a large number of people.
-   The Jewish religious leaders persecuted Jesus because they did not
    like what he was teaching.
-   After Jesus went back to heaven, the Jewish religious leaders and
    the Roman government persecuted the Christians. However, the believers
    refused to stop preaching and teaching about Jesus, and the Church
    continued to grow.
-   Other words for “persecution” are “mistreatment” or,
“abuse” or,
    “oppression” or, “hostility.”

Examples from the Bible stories:
--------------------------------

    “The rocky ground is a person who hears God’s word and accepts
    it with joy. But when he experiences hardship or **persecution**,
    he falls away.” That day many people in Jerusalem started
    **persecuting** the followers of Jesus, so the believers fled to
    other places.  Saul heard someone say, “Saul! Saul! Why do you
    **persecute** me?” Saul asked, “Who are you, Master?” Jesus
    replied to him, “I am Jesus. You are **persecuting** me!” But
    Ananias said, “Master, I have heard how this man has **persecuted**
    the believers.”
