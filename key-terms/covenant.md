========

Definition:
-----------

A covenant is a formal, binding agreement between two parties that they
must fulfill.

-   This agreement can be between individuals, between groups of people,
    or between God and people.
-   When people make a covenant with each other, they say that they will
    do something, and they must do it.
-   Examples of covenants include marriage covenants, business
    agreements, and treaties between countries.
-   On several occasions, God made a covenant with his people.  -   In
some of the covenants, God promised to fulfill his part without
    conditions.
-   In other covenants, God promised to fulfill his part if the people
    obeyed him and fulfilled their part of the covenant.

Examples from the Bible stories:
--------------------------------

    Then God made a **covenant** with Abram. A **covenant** is an
    agreement between two parties.  will make Ishmael a great nation,
    too, but my **covenant** will be with Isaac.” After a long time,
    Abraham died and all of the promises that God had made to him in the
    **covenant** were passed on to Isaac.  The **covenant** promises God
    had promised to Abraham and then to Isaac now passed on to Jacob.”
    God said to Moses and the people of Israel, “If you will obey my
    voice and keep my **covenant**, you will be my prized possession,
    a kingdom of priests, and a holy nation.” Then God gave them
    the **covenant** and said, “I am Yahweh, your God, who saved you
    from slavery in Egypt. Do not worship other gods.” Then Joshua
    reminded the people of their obligation to obey the **covenant**
    that God had made with the Israelites at Sinai.
