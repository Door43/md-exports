Examples from the Bible stories:
--------------------------------

    When the time was near for Mary to give birth, the **Roman**
    government told everyone to go for a census to the town where their
    ancestors had lived.  Then Jesus asked the demon, “What is your
    name?” He replied, “My name is Legion, because we are many.”
    (A “legion” was a group of several thousand soldiers in the
    **Roman** army.)  Early the next morning, the Jewish leaders brought
    Jesus to the **Roman** governor, Pilate, hoping to have Jesus killed.
    The **Roman** soldiers whipped Jesus and put a royal robe and a
    crown made of thorns on him. Then they mocked him by saying, “Look,
    the King of the Jews!”
