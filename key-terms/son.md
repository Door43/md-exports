Examples from the Bible stories:
--------------------------------

    God spoke to Abram and promised again that he would have a **son**
    and as many descendants as the stars in the sky.  God said, “”I
    will give you a **son** from your own body.” About a year later,
    when Abraham was 100 years old and Sarah was 90, Sarah gave birth
    to Abraham's **son**.  When they reached the place of sacrifice,
    Abraham tied up his **son** Isaac and laid him on an altar. He was
    about to kill his **son** when God said, “Stop! Do not hurt the
    boy! Now I know that you fear me because you did not keep your only
    **son** from me.” When she saw the baby, she took him as her own
    **son**.  God killed every one of the Egyptians' firstborn **sons**.
    After many years, David died, and his **son** Solomon began to rule.
    “Is this the **son** of Joseph?‚” they said.
