demon

Definition:
-----------

Demons are spirit beings that oppose God's will.

-   God created spirit beings to serve him. Some rebelled against him
    and are called “demons.” Those who continue to serve him are
    called “angels.”
-   Demons and angels are more powerful than humans, but not as powerful
    as God.
-   Sometimes demons attack people or try to control them. We call this,
    “demon-possession.”
-   Demons sometimes use their power to make idols or false gods appear
    to be real.
-   Jesus gave his apostles power over the demons.  -   When Jesus
returns to earth, he will punish everyone who has
    rebelled against him, including the demons, Satan, and unbelievers.
-   “Demon” can also be translated as, “evil spirit.”

The opposite of “demon” is an “angel.”

Examples from the Bible stories:
--------------------------------

    Many people who had **demons** in them were brought to Jesus. When
    Jesus commanded them, the **demons** came out of the people, and
    often shouted, “You are the Son of God!” The **demons** came
    out of the man and entered the pigs.  Finally one day when the slave
    girl started yelling, Paul turned to her and said to the **demon**
    that was in her, “In the name of Jesus, come out of her.” Right
    away the **demon** left her.
     walked on water, calmed storms, healed many sick people,
    drove out **demons**, raised the dead to life, and turned five loaves
    of bread and two small fish into enough food for over 5,000 people.
