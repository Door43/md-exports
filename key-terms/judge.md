Examples from the Bible stories:
--------------------------------

    The prophets warned the people that if they did not stop doing evil
    and start obeying God, then God would **judge** them as guilty, and
    he would punish them.  king is someone who rules over a kingdom and
    **judges** the people.  The Messiah would come would be the perfect
    king who would sit on the throne of his ancestor David. He would
    reign over the whole world forever, and who would always **judge**
    honestly and make the right decisions.  The high priest tore his
    clothes in anger and shouted to the other religious leaders, “We
    do not need any more witnesses! You have heard him say that he is
    the Son of God. What is your **judgment**?” But God will **judge**
    everyone who does not believe in Jesus. He will throw them into hell,
    where they will weep and grind their teeth in anguish forever.
