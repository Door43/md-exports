Definition:
-----------

Sin is anything that we do or say that is against what God wants.

-   When we disobey God's commands and desires we are sinning.  -   We
can sin by active disobedience , or by inaction


Adam and Eve sinned by eating the fruit that God told them not to eat.
Before that there was no sin in the world. Sin is passed from parent to
child through the entire human race. God must punish sin.

Examples from the Bible stories:
--------------------------------

    God said, “I promise I will never again curse the ground because of
    the evil things people do, or destroy the world by causing a flood,
    even though people are **sinful** from the time they are children.”
    God was very angry with them because of their **sin** and planned
    to destroy them.  The kingdoms of Israel and Judah both **sinned**
    against God. They broke the covenant that God made with them at Sinai.
    The prophets also said that the Messiah would be perfect, having no
    **sin**. He would die to receive the punishment for other people's
    **sin**.  One day, Jesus was teaching many tax collectors and other
    **sinners** who had gathered to hear him.  Then Jesus took a cup
    and said, “Drink this. It is my blood of the New Covenant that is
    poured out for the forgiveness of **sins**.  Peter answered them,
    “Every one of you should repent and be baptized in the name of
    Jesus Christ so that God will forgive your **sins**.” all deserve
    to die for our **sins**!  Even though you are a Christian, you will
    still be tempted to **sin**. But God is faithful and says that if
    you confess your **sins**, he will forgive you. He will give you
    strength to fight against **sin**.
