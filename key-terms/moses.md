Examples from the Bible stories:
--------------------------------

    One day while **Moses** was taking care of his sheep, he saw a bush
    that was on fire.  **Moses** told the Israelites, “Stop being
    afraid! God will fight for you today and save you.” God told
    **Moses** to raise his hand over the sea and divide the waters.
    When the Israelites saw that the Egyptians were dead, they trusted
    in God and believed that Moses was a prophet of God.  Then God
    wrote these Ten Commandments on two stone tablets and gave them
    to **Moses**.
