God the Father
==============

###

Facts:
------

God the Father, together with the Son and the Holy Spirit, is Yahweh,
the one true God.

-   God exists as the Father, the Holy Spirit, and the Son. Each one is
    fully God, and yet they are only one God. This is a mystery that
    mere humans cannot fully understand.
-   The title, “God the Father,” expresses the kind of personal
    relationship that he has to “God the Son.” It is not a physical
    relationship. Rather, it expresses that the Son honors and serves
    the Father.
-   God the Father sends the Holy Spirit to his people.  -   Anyone who
believes in the Son becomes a child of God the Father.

Examples from the Bible stories:
--------------------------------

    There is only one God. But John heard **God the Father** speak,
    and saw Jesus the Son and the Holy Spirit when he baptized Jesus.
    Then Jesus said, “This is what my **heavenly Father** will do
    to every one of you if you do not forgive your brother from your
    heart.” Then Jesus looked up to heaven and said, “**Father**,
    thank you for hearing me.” Then Jesus cried out, “It is
    finished! **Father**, I give my spirit into your hands.” “So go,
    make disciples of all people groups by baptizing them in the name of
    **the Father**, the Son, and the Holy Spirit and by teaching them to
    obey everything I have commanded you.” “Jesus is now exalted to
    the right hand of **God the Father**.” “Then the righteous ones
    will shine like the sun in the kingdom of **God their Father**.”
