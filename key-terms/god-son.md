Examples from the Bible stories:
--------------------------------

    The angel explained, “The Holy Spirit will come to you, and the
    power of God will overshadow you. So the baby will be holy, the **Son
    of God**.” God had told John, “The Holy Spirit will come down and
    rest on someone you baptize. That person is **the Son of God**.”?
    The disciples were amazed. They worshiped Jesus, saying to him,
    “Truly, you are **the Son of God**.” Martha answered, “Yes,
    Master! I believe you are the Messiah, the **Son of God**.” go,
    make disciples of all people groups by baptizing them in the name
    of the Father, **the Son**, and the Holy Spirit, and by teaching
    them to obey everything I have commanded you.” Right away, Saul
    began preaching to the Jews in Damascus, saying, “Jesus is the
    **Son of God**!” But God loved everyone in the world so much that
    he gave his only **Son** so that whoever believes in Jesus will not
    be punished for his sins, but will live with God forever.
