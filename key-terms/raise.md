Examples from the Bible stories:
--------------------------------

    The prophets foretold that the Messiah would die and that God would
    also **raise** him from the dead.  “Jesus is not here. He has
    **risen** from the dead, just like he said he would!” “Although
    Jesus died, God **raised** him from the dead. This fulfills the
    prophecy which says, ‘You will not let your Holy One rot in the
    grave.’ We are witnesses to the fact that God **raised** Jesus to
    life again.” You killed the author of life, but God **raised**
    him from the dead.  ” Peter answered them, “This man stands
    before you healed by the power of Jesus the Messiah. You crucified
    Jesus, but God **raised** him to life again!” This meant that Satan
    would kill the Messiah, but God would **raise** him to life again,
    and then the Messiah will crush the power of Satan forever.
     walked on water, calmed storms, healed many sick people,
    drove out demons, **raised** the dead to life, and turned five loaves
    of bread and two small fish into enough food for over 5,000 people.
    You must believe that Jesus is the Son of God, that he died on the
    cross instead of you, and that God **raised** him to life again.
