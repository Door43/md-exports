Examples from the Bible stories:
--------------------------------

    “So Abram's wife, **Sarai**, said to him, “Since God has not
    allowed me to have children and now I am too old to have children,
    here is my servant, Hagar. Marry her also so she can have a child for
    me.” ”'Your wife, **Sarai**, will have a son–he will be the son
    of promise.'” “God also changed **Sarai's** name to **Sarah**,
    which means “princess.” “About a year later, when Abraham was
    100 years old and **Sarah** was 90, **Sarah** gave birth to Abraham's
    son. They named him Isaac as God had told them to do.”
