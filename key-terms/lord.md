--------------------------------

    But Jesus replied to Satan by quoting from the Scriptures. He said,
    “In God's word, he commands his people, ‘Do not test the **Lord**
    your God.’” Jesus replied, “Get away from me, Satan! In God’s
    word he commands his people, ‘Worship only the **Lord** your God
    and only serve him.’” This is the year of the **Lord's** favor.
    The law expert replied that God's law says, “Love the **Lord**
    your God with all your heart, soul, strength, and mind.” Then
    Peter said to Jesus, “**Master**, if it is you, command me to come
    to you on the water” “But know for certain that God has caused
    Jesus to become both **Lord** and Messiah!” means of this demon
    she predicted the future for people, she made a lot of money for her
    **masters** as a fortuneteller.  Paul answered, “Believe in Jesus,
    the **Master**, and you and your family will be saved.”
