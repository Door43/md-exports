“To beg” is to ask for something earnestly, urgently, and often
humbly.

-   “Beg” can also mean to ask for money; a beggar is someone who sits
    or stands in a public place to ask people for money.

Examples from the Bible stories:
--------------------------------

    God sent frogs all over Egypt. Pharaoh **begged** Moses to take away
    the frogs.  “The king called the servant and said, ‘You wicked
    servant! I forgave your debt because you **begged** me.” The demons
    **begged** Jesus, “Please do not send us out of this region!”
    There was a herd of pigs feeding on a nearby hill. So, the demons
    **begged** Jesus, “Please send us into the pigs instead!” The
    man who used to have the demons **begged** to go along with Jesus.
    His father came out and **begged** him to come and celebrate with
    them, but he refused.” One day, Peter and John were going to the
    Temple. As they approached the Temple gate, they saw a crippled man
    who was **begging** for money.
