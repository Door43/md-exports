Sabbath
=======

###

Definition:
-----------

The Sabbath day was a special day each week that God told the Israelites
to set apart as a day of rest.

-   Each Sabbath was the seventh  day of the week.  -   After God finished
creating the world in six days, he rested on the
    seventh day. In the same way, God commanded the Israelites to set
    aside the seventh day as a special day to rest and worship him.

Examples from the Bible stories:
--------------------------------

    “Always be sure to keep the **Sabbath day** holy. That is, do all
    your work in six days, for the seventh day is a day for you to rest
    and to honor me.” Jesus went to the town of Nazareth where he had
    lived during his childhood. On the **Sabbath**, he went to the place
    of worship.  The day after Jesus was buried was a **Sabbath** day,
    and the Jews were not permitted to go to the tomb on that day.
