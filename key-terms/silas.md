Examples from the Bible stories:
--------------------------------

    One day, Paul and his friend **Silas** went to the town of Philippi to
    proclaim the good news about Jesus.  She  invited Paul and **Silas**
    to stay at her house, so they stayed with her and her family.
    Paul and **Silas** often met with people at the place of prayer.
    the owners of the slave girl took Paul and **Silas** to the Roman
    authorities, who beat them and threw them into jail.  They put Paul
    and **Silas** in the most secure part of the prison and even locked
    up their feet.  The jailer trembled as he came to Paul and **Silas**
    and asked, “What must I do to be saved?” The next day the leaders
    of the city released Paul and **Silas** from prison and asked them
    to leave Philippi. Paul and **Silas** visited Lydia and some other
    friends and then left the city.
