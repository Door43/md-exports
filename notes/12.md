12. The Exodus
==============

Overview:
---------

The “Exodus” refers to the time when the Israelites left Egypt. God
appeared as a pillar of cloud and fire to lead them to the Promised
Land. When Pharaoh changed his mind and pursued Israel, God separated
the waters of the sea so that the Israelites could walk through on dry
ground. The Egyptians drowned when they tried to follow them. Israel
celebrates that great victory every year with the Passover Feast.
