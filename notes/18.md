18. The Divided Kingdom
=======================

Overview:
---------

God blessed Solomon with wisdom and wealth. Solomon built a beautiful
temple for God, but then began to worship the false gods of his foreign
wives. Therefore God divided Solomonâ€™s kingdom. Only two of the twelve
tribes of Israel followed his son, Rehoboam. They became the kingdom
of Judah. The other ten tribes followed Jeroboam and served idols. They
became the kingdom of Israel.
