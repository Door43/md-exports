43. The Church Begins
=====================

Overview:
---------

The disciples waited in Jerusalem as Jesus commanded. During the feast
of Pentecost, they became filled with the Holy Spirit and began to
speak in other languages. When a crowd of people gathered, Peter told
them that this miracle was a sign that Jesus was the Messiah. When the
people heard this, 3000 of them believed and were baptized. They began
to meet together for teaching, prayer and fellowship.
