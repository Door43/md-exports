29. The Story of the Unmerciful Servant
=======================================

Overview:
---------

Peter asked Jesus how many times he should forgive a brother. So Jesus
told the story of a servant who owed a huge debt to the king. The king
took pity on him and cancelled the debt. But the servant sent another
man who owed him a small amount to prison. This made the king very
angry. Jesus told Peter that we should forgive others in the same way
that we are forgiven.
