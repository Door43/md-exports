14. Wandering in the Wilderness
===============================

Overview:
---------

God brought the Israelites to the Promised Land and told them to destroy
the Canaanites who lived there, and their idols. But the Israelites were
afraid of the Canaanites and rebelled against God and Moses. Therefore,
God made the Israelites wander in the desert until that generation died.
But God provided food and water for them throughout that time. When
Moses died, God appointed Joshua to lead the people.
