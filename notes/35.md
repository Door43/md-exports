35. The Story of the Compassionate Father
=========================================

Overview:
---------

The religious leaders complained to each other because Jesus was teaching
sinners, including tax collectors. So Jesus told them about a man who
divided his inheritance between his two sons. The younger son went away
and wasted his money in sinful living. But he came back to his father,
who received him with joy. The older son became angry, but it was
necessary to celebrate the return of the lost son.
