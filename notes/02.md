2. Sin Enters the World
=======================

Overview:
---------

God created a perfect world for Adam and Eve, but they were not
satisfied. They ate the only fruit that was forbidden. This brought sin
and suffering into the world. They immediately became fearful and ashamed,
and were separated from God. Therefore, God removed them from the garden
so they would not live forever in that sinful condition.
