50. Jesus Returns
=================

Overview:
---------

The Church has waited for the return of Jesus for almost 2000 years.
Jesus taught that unbelievers would continue to increase during this
time like weeds among wheat. However, when Jesus returns, the angels
will take the unbelievers and Satan away to judgment. Believers will
live with Jesus forever in a perfect new heaven and new earth.
