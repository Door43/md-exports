19. The Prophets
================

Overview:
---------

God spoke to Israel through the prophets. He sent Elijah to rebuke
King Ahab, and to challenge the prophets of the false god, Baal. God
sent Elisha to heal Naaman from his leprosy. God protected Jeremiah
when he was treated very badly by the people. In spite of opposition,
the prophets faithfully told the people that God would send the Messiah.
