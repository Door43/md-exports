10. The Ten Plagues
===================

Overview:
---------

Moses returned to Egypt and told Pharaoh to release the Israelites to
serve God. When Pharaoh refused, God sent ten plagues, each worse than
the previous, to force him to agree. The first nine plagues caused
horrible suffering for the Egyptians. Despite the plagues, however,
Pharaoh refused to obey God.
