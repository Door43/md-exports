41. God Raises Jesus from the Dead
==================================

Overview:
---------

After three days in the tomb, Jesus rose from the dead! It did not matter
that soldiers guarded his tomb. When an angel appeared to open the tomb,
the soldiers were terrified. When some of the women who followed Jesus
came to put spices on his body, the angel told them that Jesus was
alive. Then Jesus also appeared to the women and told them to tell the
disciples that he had risen.
