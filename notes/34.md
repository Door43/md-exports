34. Jesus Teaches Other Stories
===============================

Overview:
---------

Jesus told several stories to explain the Kingdom of God. It grows like
a mustard seed, and spreads like yeast in bread dough. It is worth more
than a hidden treasure or a perfect pearl. However, it must be received
with humility. Those who pray and ask God for mercy will be forgiven.
But God will not forgive people who are proud.
