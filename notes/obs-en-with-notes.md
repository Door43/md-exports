The Beginning 01-01
=====================


This is how **the beginning** of everything happened.  **God created**
the **universe** and everything in it in six days. After God created
the earth it was **dark** and **empty**, and **nothing had been formed**
in it. But **God's Spirit** was there over the water.

Translation Notes:
------------------

-   **the beginning** - That is, “the beginning of all things,” before
    anything existed except God.
-   **created** - This is used here in the sense of making something out
    of nothing.
-   **universe** - This includes everything that God created on the
    earth and in the heavens, both visible and invisible things.
-   **dark** - It was completely dark. There was no light at all, since
    God had not yet created light.
-   **empty** - God had not yet created anything except for the bare
    earth covered by water.
-   **nothing had been formed** - There were no distinguishing
    features–just water covering everything.
-   **God's Spirit** - The Spirit of God, sometimes called the Holy
    Spirit, was present in the beginning, moving freely over the earth
    in order to create all that he had planned to do.

God Created Light 01-02
=========================


Then **God said**, “**Let there be** light!” And there was
**light**. God saw that the light **was good** and called it “day.”
He separated it from the darkness, which he called “night.” God
created the light on the first day of **creation**.

Translation Notes:
------------------

-   **God said** - God created light by means of a simple verbal
    command.
-   **let there be** - This is a command that happened immediately
    because it was spoken by God. It may be more natural to translate
    this as a statement of certainty that this would definitely happen.
    For example, you could translate this as, “God said, 'There will
    be light.'”
-   **light** - This was a special light that God created–the sun was
    not created until later.
-   **was good** - This phrase is often repeated through the Creation
    story, and emphasizes that each stage of creation was pleasing to
    God and accomplished his plan and purpose.
-   **creation** - This word is used here to refer to the six-day period
    during which God made everything that exists.

God Created Sky 01-03
=======================


On **the second day** of creation, **God spoke** and **created** the
**sky** above the earth. He made the sky by separating the water above
from the water below.

Translation Notes:
------------------

-   **the second day** - God's work of creation was orderly, purposeful,
    and sequential. The things he created each day built upon and depended
    on the acts of the previous days.
-   **God spoke** - God created the sky by speaking a command.  -
**created** - God made the sky out of nothing.  -   **sky** - This term
refers to all of the space above the earth,
    including the air we breathe and the heavens.

God Created the Land 01-04
============================


On the **third day**, **God spoke** and separated the water from the dry
land. He called the dry land “**earth**,” and he called the water
“seas.” God saw that what he had **created** was **good**.

Translation Notes:
------------------

-   **third day** - The next in the series of orderly days in which God
    prepared the earth for life.
-   **God spoke** - God created the dry land by speaking a command.
-   **earth** - This word is used here to refer to dirt or soil, which
    is what dry land is made of. The word “earth” in refers to the
    whole world that people live on.
-   **created** - This word is used here in the sense of making
    something out of nothing.

God Created the Plants 01-05
==============================


Then **God said**, “**Let the earth produce** **all kinds** of trees and
plants.” And that is what happened. God saw that what he had **created**
**was good**.

Translation Notes:

-   **let the earth produce** - This is a command that happened
    immediately because God spoke it.
-   **all kinds** - The many different species, or types, of plants and
    trees.
-   **created** - This word is used here in the sense of making
    something out of nothing.

    story, and emphasizes that each stage of creation was pleasing to
    God and accomplished his plan and purpose.

God Created the Sun, Moon and Stars 01-06
===========================================


On **the fourth day** of creation, **God spoke** and made the sun, the
moon, and the stars. **God** made them to give **light** to the earth
and to mark **day and night, seasons and years**. God saw that what he
had **created** was **good**.

Translation Notes:
------------------

-   **the fourth day** - The next in the orderly series of days in which
    God created.
-   **God spoke** - God created the sun, moon, and stars by speaking a
    command.
-   **light** - Shining objects in the sky now provided light for the
    earth.
-   **day and night, seasons and years** - God created a different light
    to mark each portion of time from small to large, and set them to
    repeat continually until the end of time.
-   **created** - This word is used here in the sense of making
    something out of nothing.

God Created the Birds and Fish 01-07
======================================


On **the fifth day**, **God spoke** and made **everything that swims**
in the water and **all the birds**. God saw that **it was good**, and
he **blessed them**.

Translation Notes:
------------------

-   **the fifth day** - God continues his orderly progression of
    creation that he started during the previous four days.
-   **God spoke** - God created the birds and water creatures by
    speaking a command.
-   **everything that swims** - God not only made fish, but every kind
    of living thing that lives in the waters. Every one exists because
    God chose to create it.
-   **all the birds** - God did not make just one kind of bird, but all
    of the amazing variety of shapes, sizes, colors, and kinds of birds.
-   **it was good** - This phrase is repeated throughout creation to
    show that every step went exactly according to God's wise plan
    and purpose.
-   **blessed them** - God speaks his desire that they would prosper and
    that things would go well for them in the world in which he had
    placed them.

God Created the Animals 01-08
===============================


On **the sixth day** of creation, **God said**, “Let there be **all
kinds** of **land animals**!” And it happened just like God said.
Some were **farm animals**, some **crawled on the ground**, and some
were **wild**. And God saw that **it was good**.

Translation Notes:
------------------

-   **the sixth day** - The next event in a continuing, orderly
    progression of days and creative acts.
-   **God said** - God's spoken word is the means by which the animals
    were created.
-   **all kinds** - This indicates a great variety, but also order.
-   **land animals** - Every kind of animal that lived on the land, as
    opposed to the birds, or animals that live in the seas.
-   **farm animals** - The kinds of land animals that commonly live
    peacefully with people–-as in tame, or domesticated animals.
-   **crawled on the ground** - This probably includes reptiles, and
    possibly the insects.
-   **wild** - The kinds of animals that do not normally live peacefully
    with people, usually because they are afraid of people, or dangerous
    to them.
-   **it was good** - This phrase is repeated throughout creation to
    show that every step went exactly according to God's wise plan
    and purpose.

God Made Man in His Image 01-09
=================================


Then **God** said, “**Let us** make human beings **in our image**
to be **like us**. They will have **authority** over the earth and all
the animals.”

Translation Notes:
------------------

-   **Let us** - This indicates God's deliberate, willful decision to
    create man in a particular way for a particular purpose. You could
    translate this as, “We will make.”
-   **us…our…us** - The Bible teaches that there is one God, but
the Old
    Testament word “God” is a plural form, and God uses plural
    pronouns when speaking to himself. Some understand this as a special
    way of speaking that expresses God's majesty, and others understand
    this as God the Father speaking to the Son and the Spirit, who are
    all God.
-   **in our image** - An image is a physical representation of someone
    or something. Humans were made in such a way that we display or
    represent some of the qualities or traits of God.
-   **like us** - Humans share some of God's characteristics, but not
    all of his qualities. This phrase should be translated with words
    that show man is similar to God, but not equal with him or the same
    as he is.
-   **authority** - God gave people the right and power to manage,
    guide, and control how the earth and the animals will be used.

God Made Adam 01-10
=====================


So **God** **took some dirt**, **formed it** into **a man**, and
**breathed life** into him. This man's name was **Adam**. God planted
a **garden** where Adam could live, and put him there to **care for it**.

Translation Notes:
------------------

-   **took some dirt** - God made man from the dust, or dry dirt from
    the ground. This word should probably be different from the general
    word used for earth.
-   **formed it** - This word expresses that God personally fashioned
    the man, comparing this to how a person creates something with
    his hands. Make sure that a different word from “create” is
    used. Note that this is very different from how he created everything
    else through a simple spoken command.
-   **a man** - Only the man was created at this time; the woman was
    created later by a different method.
-   **breathed life** - This phrase expresses God's very personal,
    intimate action as he transferred life from himself into Adam's body,
    comparing this to how a human being breathes out air.
-   **life** - In this event, God breathed both physical and spiritual
    life into the man.
-   **Adam** - Adam's name is the same as the Old Testament word for
    “man,” and similar to the word for “dirt” from which he
    was formed.
-   **garden** - An area of land planted with trees and plants for a
    purpose–usually to produce food or to provide beauty.
-   **care for it** - To maintain the garden by tending, weeding,
    watering, harvesting, planting, etc.

Two Trees 01-11
=================


**In the middle** of the **garden**, **God** planted two special
trees—the **tree of life** and the **tree of the knowledge** of **good**
and **evil**. God told **Adam** that he could eat from any tree in the
garden except from the tree of the knowledge of good and evil. If he
ate from this tree, he would **die**.

Translation Notes:
------------------

-   **in the middle** - The central location emphasizes the importance
    of the two trees.
-   **garden** - An area of land planted with trees and plants for a
    purpose–usually to produce food or to provide beauty.
-   **tree of life** - Anyone who ate fruit from this tree would never
    die.
-   **tree of knowledge of good and evil** - The fruit of this tree
    could enable a person to know both good and evil.
-   **knowledge** - To know or understand by personal experience.  -
**good and evil** - Evil is the opposite of good. Just as “good”
    refers to what is pleasing to God, “evil” refers to everything
    that is not pleasing to God.
-   **die** - In this instance, he would die both physically and
    spiritually.

Adam Was Alone 01-12
======================


Then **God** said, “It is **not good** for man to be **alone**.”
But none of the animals could be **Adam's helper**.

Translation Notes:
------------------

-   **not good** - This is the first time that anything in creation was
    not good. It means it was, “not yet good” because God was not
    finished with the creation of humans.
-   **alone** - Adam was the only human, with no possibility of a
    relationship with another person, and unable to reproduce children
    and multiply.
-   **Adam's helper** - There was no one who was similar enough to Adam
    to join with him to accomplish the task that God gave to him. None
    of the animals could do this.

God Made Eve 01-13
====================


So **God** made **Adam** fall into **a deep sleep**. Then God **took one
of Adam's ribs and made** it into **a woman** and **brought her to him**.

Translation Notes:
------------------

-   **a deep sleep** - This was a deeper sleep than normal.  -   **took
one of Adam's ribs and made** - The verbs indicate God's very
    personal act of removing the rib from Adam and shaping it into
    a woman.
-   **a woman** - She was the first woman, the female version of human
    beings that was missing until now.
-   **brought her to him** - God personally introduced them. He
    presented the woman to Adam, almost like offering a special gift.

Adam Met Eve 01-14
====================


When **Adam** saw her, he said, “**At last**! This one is **like
me**! Let her be called '**Woman**,' for she was **made from Man**.”
This is why **a man leaves** his father and mother and **becomes one**
with his wife.

Translation Notes:
------------------

-   **At last!** - Adam's exclamation indicates that he had been waiting
    for something like the woman.
-   **like me** - The woman was the same type of being as Adam, even
    though there were important differences between them.
-   **Woman** - This word is the feminine form of the word for man.
-   **made from man** - The woman was formed directly from Adam's own
    body.
-   **a man leaves** - This is stated in the present tense to indicate
    what would become the normal situation in the future. Adam did not
    have a mother or father, but all other men would.
-   **becomes one** - The husband and wife will share an intimate bond
    of unity and a commitment to one another that will surpass their
    relationships to anyone else.

Fill the Earth 01-15
======================


**God made** man and woman **in his own image**. He **blessed** them
and told them, “Have many children and grandchildren and fill the
earth!” And God saw that everything he had made was **very good**,
and he was very pleased with all of it. This all happened on the sixth
day of **creation**.

Translation Notes:
------------------

-   **God made** - God formed the man and the woman in a very personal
    way.
-   **in his own image** - An image is a physical representation of
    someone or something. God made people to display or represent some
    of his qualities and traits, but not to be equal to him.
-   **very good** - More intense than the, “it was good” statements on
    previous days. “Very good” refers to all of creation, not just the
    man and the woman. Everything was exactly as God intended it to be.
-   **creation** - The six-day period during which God made everything
    that exists.

God Rested 01-16
==================


When **the seventh day** came, **God** had **finished his work**. So
**God rested** from all he had been doing. He **blessed the seventh day**
and **made it holy**, because on this day he rested from his work. This
is how God created **the universe** and everything in it.

*A Bible story from: Genesis 1-2*

Translation Notes:
------------------

-   **the seventh day** - The next day after the six days of creation
    were completed.
-   **finished his work** - Specifically, God finished the work of
    creation. He still performs other work.
-   **God rested** - God “rested” in the sense that he stopped working
    because creation was complete. God was not tired, or unable to
    continue.
-   **blessed the seventh day** - God had a special, positive plan for
    the seventh day, and for every seventh day to follow.
-   **made it holy** - That is, God “set apart” the day as a special
    day. It was not to be used in the same way as the other six days of
    the week.
-   **the universe** - This includes everything that God created on the
    earth and in the heavens, both visible and invisible things.
-   *A Bible story from* - These references may be slightly different in
    some Bible translations.

A Perfect World 02-01
=======================


**Adam** and his wife were very happy living in the beautiful garden
**God** had made for them.  Neither of them wore clothes, but this
did not cause them to feel any **shame**, because there was no **sin**
in the world. They often walked in the garden and **talked with God**.

Translation Notes:
------------------

-   **garden** - A special collection of trees and plants that God
    prepared for Adam and Eve to enjoy and from which to eat. This should
    be the same word that was used in See how you translated it there.
-   **talked with God** - The word for “talk” should be the same as
    would be used to refer to talking to a human being. God may have
    taken a physical form to talk to the man and the woman since the
    text indicates that they talked to him face-to-face.
-   **shame** - The feeling that comes with knowing we have sinned or
    that we fall short in some way. Before sin came into the world,
    there was no sense of shame about being naked.

The Snake 02-02
=================


But there was a **crafty snake** in the garden. He asked the woman,
“**Did God really tell you** not to eat the **fruit from any of the
trees** in the garden?”

Translation Notes:
------------------

-   **crafty** - Clever and sly, with the intent to deceive.  -
**snake** - An elongated, legless land creature that now moves by
    wiggling on its belly. Although later on in the story it is revealed
    that the snake is Satan, this should not be said here in this frame.
-   **Did God really tell you** - The snake asked the woman whether God
    actually said not to eat from any of the trees in the garden. But he
    was only pretending that he didn't know what God had said because
    he wanted to create doubt in the woman's mind. He wanted her to
    question God's goodness.
-   **fruit of any of the trees** - All of the various types of fruit
    from each of the different trees in the garden.

Do Not Touch 02-03
====================


The woman answered, “**God** told us we could eat the **fruit** of any
tree except from the **tree of the knowledge of good and evil**. God told
us, ‘If you eat that fruit or even touch it, **you will die**.’”

Translation Notes:
------------------

-   **fruit** - We don't know what kind of fruit this was. We only know
    that it grew on this tree. If possible it is best to use a general
    word for fruit here, and not a word for a specific kind of fruit.
-   **tree of the knowledge of good and evil** - The woman correctly
    understood that they were not allowed to eat from this one tree that
    would enable them to understand evil as well as good.
-   **you will die** - Use your ordinary word for death, for a person's
    physical life to end. Don't avoid the term just because the thought
    of death sounds too harsh.

The Lie 02-04
===============


The snake responded to the woman, “That is not **true**! You will
not **die**.  **God** just knows that as soon as you eat it, you will
be **like God** and will **understand good and evil** like he does.”

Translation Notes:
------------------

-   **like God** - The man and the woman were already made in the
    likeness of God. The snake is suggesting that the woman would be
    more like God if she understood evil. However, God never intended
    for her to have this knowledge.
-   **understand good and evil** - To know from personal experience what
    things are good and what things are bad, or being able to know
    whether something is good or bad.

Disobedience 02-05
====================


The woman saw that the fruit was beautiful and looked delicious. She also
wanted to be **wise**, so she picked some of the fruit and ate it. Then
she gave some to her husband, **who was with her**, and he ate it, too.

Translation Notes:
------------------

-   **wise** - The woman wanted to have insight and understanding like
    the snake seemed to have, and like God has.
-   **who was with her** - This is important information because it
    shows that the man was present when the woman made the decision to
    eat the fruit.

Open Eyes 02-06
=================


Suddenly, **their eyes were opened**, and they realized **they were
naked**. They tried to **cover their bodies** by sewing leaves together
to make clothes.

Translation Notes:
------------------

-   **their eyes were opened** - This could be translated as, “they saw
    things differently.” This expression means they now understood
    something for the first time. In your language, there may be an
    expression with similar meaning that you could use to translate this.
-   **realized they were naked** - After the man and the woman disobeyed
    God, they felt ashamed that they were naked. That is why they used
    leaves to try to cover their naked bodies.
-   **cover their bodies** - The man and the woman attempted to use
    leaves to hide themselves from God.

Where Are You? 02-07
======================


Then the man and his wife heard the sound of **God walking** through the
garden. They both hid from God. Then God called to the man, “**Where
are you?**” **Adam** replied, “I heard you walking in the garden,
and I was afraid, because I was naked.  So I hid.”

Translation Notes:
------------------

-   **God walking** - It seems that God regularly came to the garden to
    walk and talk with the man and the woman. We do not know what this
    looked like. If it is possible, it is best to use the same word that
    would be used to talk about a person walking.
-   **Where are you?** - God already knew the answer to this question.
    The purpose of the question was to force the man and the woman to
    explain why they were hiding.

The Blame 02-08
=================


Then **God** asked, “**Who told you that you were naked?** Did you eat
the fruit I told you not to eat?” The man answered, “You gave me this
woman, and **she gave me the fruit**.” Then God asked the woman, “What
have you done?” The woman replied, “**The snake tricked me**.”

Translation Notes:
------------------

-   **Who told you that you were naked?** - Or, “How did you find out
    that you were naked?” God already knows the answer to all of his
    questions. By asking this question and the following question, he
    was giving Adam the opportunity to admit his sin of disobedience.
    Being naked was not a sin. God created them that way. Their knowledge
    of their nakedness was the problem. Their shame showed that they
    had sinned.
-   **she gave me the fruit** - The man blamed the woman rather than
    confessing his disobedience and accepting responsibility for
    disobeying God.
-   **What have you done?** - Or, “Why have you done this?” God
already
    knew the answer to this question. By asking this question, he was
    giving the woman the opportunity to admit her guilt. He was also
    implying that she should not have done what she did.
-   **The snake tricked me** - The snake deceived or misled her. He lied
    to her. Don't use a word that indicates that he cast a spell on her
    or bewitched her. The woman blamed the snake rather than confessing
    her disobedience and accepting responsibility for disobeying God.

God Cursed the Snake 02-09
============================


**God** said to the snake, “**You are cursed**! You will slide on your
belly and eat dirt. You and the woman will **hate each other**, and your
children and her children will hate each other, too. The **woman’s
descendant** will **crush your head**, and you will **wound his heel**.”

Translation Notes:
------------------

-   **you are cursed** - This could also be translated as, “I curse
you”
    or, “Great harm will come to you.” Do not use a word that
    implies magic.
-   **hate each other** - The woman would hate the snake and the snake
    would hate the woman. The women's descendants would also hate the
    snake's descendants, and the snake's descendants would hate them.
-   **woman's descendant** - Refers to one of her descendants in
    particular.
-   **crush your head** - The descendant of the woman will destroy the
    descendant of the snake.
-   **wound his heel** - The descendant of the snake will wound the
    descendant of the woman.

God Cursed the Woman 02-10
============================


**God** then said to the woman, “I will make **childbirth very painful**
for you. You will desire your husband, and he will rule over you.”

Translation Notes:
------------------

-   **childbirth very painful** - Some languages may need to express
    this as a verb. You could say, “I will cause you to have much more
    pain when you give birth to children.”

God Cursed the Man 02-11
==========================


**God** said to the man, “You listened to your wife and **disobeyed**
me. Now the **ground is cursed**, and you will need to work hard to grow
food. Then **you will die**, and your body will **return to dirt**.”
The man named his wife **Eve, which means “life-giver**,” because
she would become the **mother of all people**.  And God clothed **Adam**
and Eve with animal skins.

Translation Notes:
------------------

-   **ground is cursed** - As punishment for Adam's disobedience, the
    earth would no longer be fruitful. Adam would have to work very hard
    to raise enough food to eat.
-   **you will die** - The ultimate punishment for their disobedience
    was death. Spiritual death is our separation from God. Physical
    death is our separation from our body.
-   **return to dirt** - God created Adam from the dirt or soil and gave
    him life. As a result of sin, his life will be taken from him and
    his body will decompose and become dirt again.
-   **Eve, which means 'life-giver'** - God gave life to Adam and Eve,
    and it is passed on to every person through childbirth.
-   **mother of all people** - This means that she would be the female
    ancestor of all people. Some languages say “she would be the
    grandmother of all people.”

Out of the Garden 02-12
=========================


Then **God** said, “Now that the human beings have become **like us by
knowing good and evil**, they must not be allowed to eat the **fruit** of
the **tree of life** and live forever.” So God sent **Adam** and **Eve**
away from the beautiful garden. God placed large, powerful **angels**
at the entrance to the garden to keep anyone from eating the fruit of
the tree of life.

*A Bible story from: Genesis 3*

Translation Notes:
------------------

-   **like us by knowing good and evil** - Here, this phrase points to a
    new way that Adam and Eve would be like God. Because they had sinned,
    they were aware of evil and could experience it. You could say,
    “because now they knew both good and evil.”
-   **fruit** - The specific kind of fruit is not revealed, so it is
    best to translate this using a general word for fruit.
-   **tree of life** - This was an actual tree with fruit. See
    If a person ate this fruit he would live continually and never die.
-   *A Bible story from* - These references may be slightly different in
    some Bible translations.

Sin Increased 03-01
=====================


**After a long time**, many people were living in the world. They had
become **very wicked and violent**. **It became so bad** that **God
decided to destroy** the whole world with a **huge flood**.

Translation Notes:
------------------

-   **After a long time** - This story happens many generations
     after creation.
-   **very wicked and violent** - It may be more natural to say, “had
    become wicked and did violent things”.
-   **It became so bad** – It may be clearer to say, “People were
    behaving in such harmful and evil ways that God.”
-   **God decided to destroy** - This does not mean that the earth would
    be destroyed completely. Rather God planned to destroy all the
    people who had rebelled against him and who had caused such evil
    and violence. This flood would also kill all the land animals and
    the birds.
-   **huge flood** - Very deep water that would cover the earth, even in
    places where the ground was normally dry, and even covering the tops
    of the highest mountains.

Noah Found Grace 03-02
========================


But **Noah found favor** with **God**. He was a **righteous** man, living
among wicked people. God told Noah about the flood He was **planning to
send**. He told Noah to build a huge boat.

Translation Notes:
------------------

-   **found favor** - God was pleased with Noah because he feared and
    obeyed God. So even though Noah was not sinless, God was gracious to
    him and made a plan to rescue his family from the devastating flood.
    Make sure this doesn't sound like Noah was lucky or that he just
    happened to escape. Rather, it was God's choice.
-   **the flood** - See how you translated this in -   **planning to
send** - God planned to cause deep water to cover the
    earth by sending a lot of rain. That is, he planned to cause the
    flood by causing a lot of rain to fall.

The Big Boat 03-03
====================


**God** told **Noah** to make **the boat** about 140 meters long, 23
meters wide, and 13.5 meters high. Noah was to build it with wood and to
make three levels, many rooms, a roof, and a window. The boat would keep
Noah, his family, and every kind of land animal safe during the flood.

Translation Notes:
------------------

-   **the boat** - The boat was big enough to carry eight people, two of
    every kind of animal, and their provisions for almost a year.

Building the Boat 03-04
=========================


**Noah** **obeyed** **God**. He and his three sons built the boat just
the way God had told them. It took many years to build the boat, because
it was so big. **Noah warned** the people about the flood that was coming
and told them to **turn to God**, but they did not believe him.

Translation Notes:
------------------

-   **Noah warned** - Noah told everyone that God planned to destroy the
    world because of sin.
-   **turn to God** - This means that they should stop sinning and start
    obeying God.

Loading the Boat 03-05
========================


**God** also commanded **Noah** and his family to gather enough food for
themselves and the animals. When everything was ready, God told Noah it
was time for him, his wife, his three sons, and their wives to get into
the boat—eight people in all.

Translation Notes:
------------------

**

The Animals Came 03-06
========================


**God sent** a male and a female of every animal and bird to **Noah**
so they could go into the boat and be kept safe during the flood. God
sent seven males and seven females of every type of animal that could be
**used for sacrifices**. When they were all in the boat, **God himself
closed the door**.

Translation Notes:
------------------

-   **God sent** - Noah did not need to find the animals. God sent them
    to him.
-   **used for sacrifices** - For some languages it may be better to say
    something like, “animals that were acceptable to sacrifice to
    God.” God had decided that people should sacrifice animals to him,
    but he only permitted them to sacrifice certain kinds of animals.
-   **God himself closed the door** - This emphasizes that it was God
    who shut the door.

The Rain Began 03-07
======================


Then it began to **rain, and rain, and rain**. It rained for forty days
and forty nights without stopping! Water also came **gushing** up out
of the earth. Everything in the **whole world was covered** with water,
even the highest mountains.

Translation Notes:
------------------

-   **rain, and rain, and rain** - This emphasizes that there was an
    unusual, extreme amount of rain. Other languages may have a different
    way of emphasizing this.
-   **gushing** - This indicates that there was a large amount of water
    coming out.
-   **whole world was covered** - This refers to all the earth being
    covered with water from the flood.

Safe from the Flood 03-08
===========================


Everything that lived on the dry land **died**, except the people and
animals that were in the boat. The boat floated on the water and kept
everything inside the boat safe from drowning.

Translation Notes:
------------------

-   **

The Rain Stopped 03-09
========================


After **the rains stopped**, the boat floated on the water for five
months, and during this time the water started going down. Then one
day the **boat rested** on the top of a mountain, but the world was
still covered with water. After **three more months**, the tops of the
**mountains were visible**.

Translation Notes:
------------------

-   **the rains stopped** – This could be translated as, “it stopped
    raining.”
-   **boat rested** - There was so much water from the rain that it
    covered the mountains. The ship floated over the mountains, and when
    the water started to go down, the ship went down with the water and
    settled on a mountain.
-   **three more months** - During the next three months, the water
    continued to go down.
-   **mountains were visible** - Other ways to translate this would be,
    “were showing” or, “appeared” or, “could be seen.” It
    may be more clear to say, “After three months, the water had gone
    down enough so that Noah and his family could clearly see the tops
    of the mountains.

The Raven 03-10
=================


After forty more days, **Noah** sent out a bird called a **raven** to
see if the water had dried up. The raven flew back and forth looking
for dry land, but it could not find any.

Translation Notes:
------------------

-   **raven** - A black bird that flies and eats a variety of plant and
    animal foods, including the rotting flesh of dead animals.

The Dove 03-11
================


Later **Noah** sent out a bird called a **dove**. But it also could not
find any dry land, so it came back to Noah. A week later he sent the dove
out again, and it came back with an **olive branch** in its beak! **The
water was going down**, and the plants were growing again!

Translation Notes:
------------------

-   **dove** - A small, white or gray flying bird that eats seeds or
    fruit.
-   **olive branch** - An olive tree's fruit contains oil which people
    use for cooking or putting on their skin. If your language does
    not have a word for “olive branch,” you could translate it
    as, “branch from a tree called 'olive'” or, “branch from
    an oil-tree.”
-   **water was going down** - It may be more natural in your language
    to say that, “the water was going away” or, “the level of the
    water was getting lower.”

Dry Land 03-12
================


**Noah** **waited another week** and sent out the dove a third time. This
time, it found a place to rest and did not come back. The water was
drying up!

Translation Notes:
------------------

-   **waited another week** - You could say, “waited seven more days.”
    The word “waited” shows that Noah was allowing time for the
    floodwaters to go down before sending out the dove again.

Leaving the Boat 03-13
========================


**Two months later God** said to **Noah**, “You and your family and
all the animals may leave the boat now. **Have many children** and
grandchildren and **fill the earth**.” So Noah and his family came
out of the boat.

Translation Notes:
------------------

-   **Two months later** - This means two months after Noah released the
    dove from the ark. It may be necessary to say this explicitly if it
    is not clear.
-   **Have many children** – To make sure it is clear that this was
    God's command and desire, you could say, “You must have many
    children.” or, “I want you to have many children.”
-   **fill the earth** - If this is not clear, it may be necessary to
    say, “and fill the earth with people” or, “so that there will
    be many people living on the earth.”

Noah's Sacrifice 03-14
========================


After **Noah** got off the boat, he built an **altar** and **sacrificed**
some of each kind of **animal that could be used for a sacrifice**.
**God was happy** with the sacrifice and **blessed** Noah and his family.

Translation Notes:
------------------

-   **animal that could be used for a sacrifice** - Another way to say
    this would be, “that people could use to sacrifice to him.”
-   **God was happy** - God was pleased with Noah for sacrificing these
    animals.

God's Promise 03-15
=====================


**God** said, “I **promise** I will **never again** **curse** the
ground because of the **evil** things that people do, or destroy the
world by causing a flood, even though **people are sinful from the time
they are children**.”

Translation Notes:
------------------

-   **never again** - This means, “not ever again” or, “not again
at any
    time” or, “truly not again”. Examples: “I will not ever again
    curse the ground” or, “I will not curse the ground again at any
    time” or, “I will truly not curse the ground again”.
-   **curse the ground** - The earth and the other creatures suffered
    because of man's sin.
-   **the world** – This refers to the earth and the living creatures
    that lived on it.
-   **people are sinful from the time they are children** - Another way
    to say this would be, “people do sinful things their entire
    lives.”

The Rainbow 03-16
===================


**God** then made the first **rainbow** as **a sign of his
promise**. **Every time** the rainbow appeared in the sky, God would
remember **what he promised** and so would his people.

*A Bible story from: Genesis 6-8*

Translation Notes:
------------------

-   **rainbow** - This is the multicolored arc of light that often
    appears in the sky after a rainstorm.
-   **a sign** - A sign is something  that
    gives a certain meaning or which points to something that is true
    or will happen.
-   **as a sign of his promise** – In some languages it may be better to
    say, “to show that he had promised.”
-   **Every time** – Make sure it is clear that this means every time a
    rainbow appeared from that time on. It may be necessary to add,
    “From then on, every time.”
-   **what he promised** - This refers back to the previous frame in
    which God promised to never again destroy the earth with a flood.
-   *A Bible story from* - These references may be slightly different in
    some Bible translations.

One People 04-01
==================


**Many years after the flood**, there were **again many people** in the
world, and they all spoke the **same language**. Instead of filling
the earth as **God** had commanded, they gathered together and built
**a city**.

Translation Notes:
------------------

-   **many years after the flood** - Many generations had passed since
    the end of the flood.
-   **again many people** - Noah's family multiplied into enough people
    to fill a city.
-   **same language** - This means there was only one language, so they
    could all understand each other.
-   **a city** - It is best to use a general word for “city” since the
    text does not give a specific name.

The Tower 04-02
=================


They were very **proud**, and they did not care about what **God**
said. They even began building a **tall tower to reach heaven**. God
saw that if they all kept working together to do **evil**, they could
do many more **sinful** things.

Translation Notes:
------------------

-   **tall tower to reach heaven** - This structure was so tall that its
    top would be in the sky.
-   **heaven** – This could be translated as, “sky.”

Many Languages 04-03
======================


So **God changed their language** into **many different languages**
and **spread the people** out all over the world. The city they had
begun to build was called **Babel**, which means, “**confused**.”

Translation Notes:
------------------

-   **changed their language** – In an instant, God miraculously gave
    them different languages to speak so that suddenly they were no
    longer able to understand each other.
-   **many different languages** – Instead of one large group of people
    speaking one language, there were now many smaller people groups
    each speaking its own separate language.
-   **spread the people** - When God changed their languages, he caused
    these groups of people to scatter out on the earth and each group
    moved to its own area.
-   **Babel** - We don't know the exact location of this city, other
    than it was somewhere in the ancient Middle East.
-   **confused** - This refers to how the people were confused or,
    “mixed-up” when they could no longer understand each other after
    God changed their language.

God Chose Abram 04-04
=======================


**Hundreds of years later, God** spoke to a man named **Abram**. God told
him, “**Leave your country** **and family** and go to the land I will
show you. I will **bless** you and **make you a great nation**. I will
**make your name great**. I will bless those who bless you and **curse**
those who curse you. **All families on earth** will be blessed because
of you.”

Translation Notes:
------------------

-   **Hundreds of years later** – This could be translated as, ”many
    generations after the people split into different language groups
    at Babel.” or, ”a long time after that happened.”
-   **Leave your country** - This refers to the area where Abram was
    born and grew up . It could be translated as, “native region” or,
    “homeland” or something similar.
-   **and family** – God was calling Abram to leave behind most of his
    relatives. However, God was not telling Abram to abandon the people
    he was responsible for, including his wife.
-   **make you a great nation** - God would cause Abram to have many
    descendants, and they would become a large and important nation
    or country.
-   **make your name great** - This means that Abram's name and family
    would become well-known throughout the world and people would think
    well of them.
-   **all families on earth** - Abram's decision to follow God would
    affect not only his own family, but also families from every people
    group on earth.

To Canaan 04-05
=================


So **Abram** **obeyed** **God**. **He took** his wife, **Sarai**,
together with all of his **servants** and everything he owned and went
to the land **God showed him**, the **land of Canaan**.

Translation Notes:
------------------

-   **He took** – Some languages would say, “He brought”
here. Others
    would use two different verbs here, such as, “He caused his wife
    to come with him” and, “He brought along all of their servants
    and possessions.”
-   **God showed him** - Somehow God made it clear to Abram where he was
    to go. The text doesn't tell how God showed him.
-   **land of Canaan** - The name of this land was “Canaan”. This
could
    be translated, “the land called Canaan.”

God Blessed Abram 04-06
=========================


When **Abram** arrived in **Canaan**, **God** said, “Look all around
you. I will give to you and your **descendants all the land that you
can see as an inheritance**”. **Then Abram settled in the land**.

Translation Notes:
------------------

-   **all the land that you can see** - If Abram was standing on a
    mountain, he could have seen a very large area. On several occasions
    God promised to give the entire land of Canaan to Abram and his
    descendants.
-   **as an inheritance** - God promised to give land to Abram and his
    descendants as a father gives land and possessions to his children.
-   **Then Abram settled in the land** - Abram lived there along with
    all those who had gone there with him.

Melchizedek 04-07
===================


One day, **Abram** met **Melchizedek**, the **priest** of **God Most
High**. Melchizedek **blessed** Abram and said, “May God Most High who
**owns heaven and earth** bless Abram.” Then Abram gave Melchizedek
a tenth of all he owned.

Translation Notes:
------------------

-   **Melchizedek** - Melchizedek was the recognized religious authority
    in Canaan who received and presented offerings to God.
-   **God Most High** - The people of Canaan worshiped many false gods.
    The title, “Most High God” explains that the God that Melchizedek
    worshiped was far superior to all of them, and was the same God that
    Abram worshiped.

No Son 04-08
==============


**Many years** went by, but **Abram** and **Sarai** still did not have
a **son**.  **God** spoke to Abram and **promised** again that he would
have a son and as many **descendants as the stars in the sky**. Abram
**believed** God's promise. God declared that Abram was **righteous**
because he believed in God's promise.

Translation Notes:
------------------

-   **Many years** - Several years had passed since God had first
    promised that Abram would have a son.
-   **as the stars in the sky** - This expression means that Abram's
    descendants will be so many that no one can count them all.

God's Covenant 04-09
======================


Then **God** made a **covenant** with **Abram**. A covenant is an
agreement between **two parties**. God said, “I will give you a
**son from your own body**. I give the land of **Canaan** to your
**descendants**.” But Abram still **did not have a son**.

*A Bible story from: Genesis 11-15*

Translation Notes:
------------------

-   **two parties** - The parties could be two people, two groups of
    people, or a person and a group of people. In this case the agreement
    was between God and Abram.
-   **from your own body** - With his own body Abram would cause his
    wife to become pregnant, so that together they would have their own,
    natural son. This was an amazing promise, since Abram and Sarai were
    very old.
-   **did not have a son** - Abram still did not have any descendants
    who could possess the land.
-   *A Bible story from* - These references may be slightly different in
    some Bible translations.

Hagar 05-01
=============


Ten years after **Abram** and **Sarai** arrived in **Canaan**, **they
still did not have a child**. So Abram's wife, Sarai, said to him,
“Since **God** has not allowed me to have children and now I am too
old to have children, here is my **servant, Hagar**. **Marry her also**
so she can **have a child for me**.”

Translation Notes:
------------------

-   **still did not have a child** - Without a child, Abram had no
    descendants to become a great nation.
-   **Marry her also** - Abram would take Hagar as a second wife, but
    Hagar would not have the full status of a wife as Sarai did. She
    was still Sarai's servant.
-   **have a child for me** - Since Hagar was Sarai's servant, Sarai
    would be considered the mother of any children that Hagar bore.

Ishmael Was Born 05-02
========================


So **Abram married Hagar**. Hagar had a baby boy, and Abram named him
**Ishmael**. But **Sarai became jealous of Hagar**. When Ishmael was
thirteen years old, **God** again spoke to Abram.

Translation Notes:
------------------

-   **married** - Hagar became Abram's concubine–a “second wife” of
    lower status. Hagar was still Sarai's servant.
-   **became jealous of Hagar** - Sarai was jealous of Hagar because
    Hagar could have children and Sarai could not.

God Renewed the Covenant 05-03
================================


God said, “I am **God** Almighty. I will make a **covenant** with
you.” Then **Abram** bowed to the ground. God also told Abram,
“You will be the **father of many nations**. I will give you and your
**descendants** the land of **Canaan** as their possession and **I
will be their God** forever. You must **circumcise** **every male in
your family**.”

Translation Notes:
------------------

-   **father of many nations** - Abram would have many descendants, and
    they would have their own lands and rule themselves. They and others
    would remember that Abram was their ancestor and would honor him.
-   **I will be their God** - Another way to say this is, “I will be the
    God that they will worship.”
-   **every male in your family** - This could be translated as, “every
    boy and man in your family.” This included Abram's servants and
    his descendants.

God Promised Isaac's Birth 05-04
==================================


“Your wife, **Sarai**, will have a son—he will be the **son of
promise**. Name him **Isaac**. **I will make my covenant with him**,
and he will become a great nation. I will make **Ishmael** a great
nation, too, but my covenant will be with Isaac.” Then **God** changed
**Abram's** name to **Abraham**, which means “**father of many**.” God
also changed Sarai's name to **Sarah**, which means “**princess**.”

Translation Notes:
------------------

- -   **son of promise** - Isaac would be the son that God promised to
    Sarai and Abram. He would also be the son that God would use to give
    Abram many descendants.
-   **I will make my covenant with him** - This would be the same
    covenant that God made with Abram.
-   **father of many** - As God had promised, Abraham would become the
    ancestor of many people who would even become many nations.
-   **princess** - A princess is a daughter of a king. The names Sarai
    and Sarah apparently both meant “princess.” But God changed
    her name to signify that she would be the mother of many nations,
    and some of her descendants would be kings.

Birth of Isaac 05-05
======================


That day **Abraham** **circumcised** **all the males in his
household**. About a year later, when Abraham was 100 years old and
**Sarah** was 90, Sarah gave birth to Abraham's **son**. They named him
**Isaac** as **God** had told them to do.

Translation Notes:
------------------

-   **all the males in his household** - This means all of the men and
    boys that Abraham was responsible for, including his male servants,
    young and old.

Test of Faith 05-06
=====================


When **Isaac** was a young man, **God tested Abraham's faith** by saying,
“Take Isaac, your only **son**, and **kill him** as a **sacrifice** to
me.” Again Abraham **obeyed** God and **prepared to sacrifice** his son.

Translation Notes:
------------------

-   **God tested Abraham's faith** - God wanted Abraham to show that he
    was completely submitted to God, that he would obey whatever God
    told him to do.
-   **kill him** - God did not want human sacrifice. God wanted to see
    that Abraham loved God more than he loved his son and would obey
    God even when God told him to give his son back to God.
-   **prepared to sacrifice** - Abraham got ready to sacrifice his son.
    God stopped him before he killed his son.

God Will Provide 05-07
========================


As **Abraham** and **Isaac** **walked to the place of sacrifice**,
Isaac asked, “Father, we have **wood for the sacrifice**, but where
is **the lamb**?” Abraham replied, “**God** will provide the lamb
for the sacrifice, my son.”

Translation Notes:
------------------

-   **walked to the place of sacrifice** - God had told Abraham to
    sacrifice Isaac on a special high hill that was about three days'
    walk from where they lived.
-   **wood for the sacrifice** - For a sacrifice, normally the lamb was
    killed and then placed on top of wood so that the wood and the lamb
    could be burned up with fire.
-   **the lamb** - A young sheep or goat would be the normal animal for
    a sacrifice.
-   **provide** - Abraham may have believed that Isaac was the “lamb”
    that God provided, although God fulfilled Abraham's words by providing
    a ram to sacrifice in Isaac's place.

The Sacrifice 05-08
=====================


When they reached the place of **sacrifice**, **Abraham** tied up his
**son** **Isaac** and laid him on an **altar**. He was about to **kill his
son** when **God** said, “**Stop! Do not hurt the boy!** Now I know that
**you fear me** because you did not keep **your only son** from me.”

Translation Notes:
------------------

-   **kill his son** - God did not want human sacrifice. God wanted to
    see that Abraham loved God more than he loved his son and would obey
    God even when God told him to give his son back to God.
-   **Stop! Do no hurt the boy!** - God protected Isaac and kept Abraham
    from killing him.
-   **you fear me** - Abraham feared God, which included respect and
    reverence for God. Because of those things, he obeyed God.
-   **your only son** - Ishmael was also Abraham's son, but Isaac was
    the only son of Abraham and Sarah. God's covenant was with Isaac
    and it was through Isaac that God would fulfill his promise.

The Ram 05-09
===============


Nearby **Abraham** saw **a ram** that was stuck in a bush.  **God had
provided the ram** to be the **sacrifice** instead of **Isaac**.
Abraham happily offered the ram as a sacrifice.

Translation Notes:
------------------

-   **a ram** - A ram is a male goat. Goats were one of the animals that
    people could sacrifice to God.
-   **God had provided the ram** - Just at the right moment, God caused
    the ram to be stuck in the bush.

The Blessing 05-10
====================


Then **God** said to **Abraham**, “Because you were willing to give me
everything, even **your only son**, I **promise** to **bless** you. Your
**descendants** will be more than the stars in the sky. Because you
have **obeyed** me, **all the families of the world** will be **blessed
through your family**.”

*A Bible story from: Genesis 16-22*

Translation Notes:
------------------

-   **your only son** - See explanation in -   **the stars in the sky**
- See explanation in -   **all the families of the world** - Here,
“families” refers to the
    larger distinct groups of people on earth, rather than to each set
    of parents and children.
-   **blessed through your family** - Here, “family” refers to
the many
    descendants that Abraham would have. The future generations of the
    world would be blessed through Abraham's descendants. The greatest
    blessing would come many generations later through God's chosen
    servant, the Messiah.
-   *A Bible story from* - These references may be slightly different in
    some Bible translations.

A Wife for Isaac 06-01
========================


When **Abraham** was very old, his **son**, **Isaac**, had grown to
be a man. So Abraham **sent one of his servants back** **to the land**
where his relatives lived **to bring back a wife for his son, Isaac**.

Translation Notes:
------------------

-   **sent one of his servants back** – This could be translated as,
    “told one of his servants to go back.” The word “back” means
    that the servant would be going to the same place where Abraham used
    to live long ago before he came to Canaan. Make sure the translation
    of this phrase makes that clear.
-   **to the land** - This land was east of where Abraham was now
    living.
-   **to bring back a wife for his son, Isaac** - This could be
    translated as, “to bring back an unmarried woman for his son,
    Isaac, to marry”.

Finding Rebekah 06-02
=======================


After a very long journey to the land where **Abraham's** relatives lived,
**God** led the **servant** to **Rebekah**. She was the **granddaughter
of Abraham's brother**.

Translation Notes:
------------------

-   **granddaughter of Abraham's brother** - Specifically, she was the
    daughter of Abraham's brother's son. Her grandfather was Abraham's
    brother.

Isaac Married Rebekah 06-03
=============================


**Rebekah agreed** to leave her family and go back with the **servant**
to **Isaac's** home. Isaac married her as soon as she arrived.

Translation Notes:
------------------

-   **Rebekah agreed** - Even though Rebekah's parents were arranging
    her marriage, they did not force her to go marry Isaac.

Rebekah Was Childless 06-04
=============================


After a long time, **Abraham** died and all of **the promises that God
had made to him in the covenant were passed on** to **Isaac**. God had
promised that Abraham would have **countless descendants**, but Isaac's
wife, **Rebekah**, could not have children.

Translation Notes:
------------------

-   **the promises … were passed on** - The promises of the covenant
    that God made with Abraham were not for him only, but also for
    his descendants.
-   **countless** - This could also be translated as, “very many.” The
    word “countless” means there would be so many descendants that
    people would not be able to count them.

Rebekah Became Pregnant 06-05
===============================


**Isaac** prayed for **Rebekah**, and **God** allowed her to get pregnant
with twins. The two babies struggled with each other while they were
still **in Rebekah's womb**, so Rebekah asked God what was happening.

Translation Notes:
------------------

-   **in Rebekah's womb** - That is, “inside her.”

Two Nations 06-06
===================


**God** told **Rebekah**, “Two nations will come **from the two sons**
inside of you. **They will struggle with each other** and **the older
son** will **serve the younger one**.”

Translation Notes:
------------------

-   **from the two sons** - That is, “from the descendants of the two
    sons.”
-   **They will struggle with each other** - Both the two sons and the
    nations that will come from them will continually fight with each
    other. Compare to
-   **the older son** - Even though the babies were twins, the baby that
    came out first would be treated as the older son.
-   **serve the younger one** – This could be translated as, “the
older
    son will have to do what the younger one tells him to do.”

Twins Were Born 06-07
=======================


When **Rebekah's babies were born**, **the older son** came out **red**
and **hairy**, and they named him **Esau**. Then **the younger son**
came out holding on to Esau's heel, and they named him **Jacob**.

*A Bible story from: Genesis 24:1-25:26*

Translation Notes:
------------------

-   **Rebekah's babies were born** - Some languages have a more indirect
    way of saying this such as, “when Rebekah saw and took them” or,
    “when Rebekah brought them to light.”
-   **the older son … the younger son** - This could be translated as,
    “the first son to come out … the second son to come out.” Make
    sure that the way “older” and “younger” are translated still
    communicates that the boys were twins.
-   **red** - This may mean that his skin was very red or that the hair
    on his body was red.
-   **hairy** - Esau had a lot of hair on his body. You could say, “the
    older son's body was red, with lots of hair.”
-   *A Bible story from* - These references may be slightly different in
    some Bible translations.

The Boys Grew Up 07-01
========================


As the boys grew up, **Jacob loved to stay at home**, but **Esau loved
to hunt**.  **Rebekah loved Jacob**, **but Isaac loved Esau**.

Translation Notes:
------------------

-   **loved to stay at home … loved to hunt** - Some languages will use
    a word for “love” here that is different from the one used for,
    “Rebekah loved Jacob.” For example, this could be translated as,
    “liked to stay at home … liked to hunt” or, “preferred to
    stay at home … preferred to hunt.”
-   **at home** - This expression refers to the area around the family
    dwellings. Jacob preferred to stay close to the tents where they
    lived. Some languages have a special expression for, “at home.”
-   **Rebekah loved Jacob, but Isaac loved Esau** - This could be
    translated as, “Rebekah was more fond of Jacob, and Isaac was more
    fond of Esau.” This does not necessarily mean that Rebekah and
    Isaac did not love the other son, but that each parent had a favorite.

Esau Sold His Rights 07-02
============================


One day, when **Esau** came back from hunting, he was very hungry. Esau
said to **Jacob**, “Please **give me some of the food** you have
made.” Jacob responded, “First, **give me your rights as the oldest
son**.” So Esau gave Jacob his **rights as the oldest son**. Then
Jacob gave him some food.

Translation Notes:
------------------

-   **give me some of the food … give me your rights** – Some
languages
    may prefer to use two different words for “give” here. This
    would also apply to, “Esau gave … Jacob gave” in the last
    two sentences.
-   **rights as the oldest son** - According to their custom, since Esau
    was the oldest son, he should have been the one to receive twice as
    much of their father's wealth when their father died. Jacob thought
    of a way to take these rights of the oldest son from Esau.

Rebekah and Jacob Tricked Isaac 07-03
=======================================


**Isaac** wanted to **give his blessing** to **Esau**. But before he did,
**Rebekah** and **Jacob tricked him** by having Jacob **pretend** to be
Esau. Isaac was old and could no longer see. So Jacob put on Esau’s
clothes and put **goatskins** on his neck and hands.

Translation Notes:
------------------

-   **give his blessing** - It was customary for fathers to formally
    express their desire for good things to happen to their children.
    Normally the older son received the best promise. Isaac wanted this
    extra prosperity to happen to Esau.
-   **tricked him** - The word “trick” means to do something to
    deliberately deceive someone. Rebekah came up with a plan to deceive
    Isaac into giving Jacob the special blessing instead of Esau.
-   **pretend** - The word “pretend” shows how Jacob would deceive his
    father .
-   **goatskins** - The hairiness of the goatskins would make Jacob feel
    like Esau.

Isaac Blessed Jacob 07-04
===========================


**Jacob came to Isaac** and said, “I am **Esau**. I have come so that
you can **bless** me.” When Isaac felt the goat hair and smelled the
clothes, **he thought it was Esau** and blessed him.

Translation Notes:
------------------

-   **Jacob came to Isaac** - In some languages it might be more natural
    to say, “Jacob went to Isaac.”
-   **he thought it was Esau** - He thought that the person he was
    touching and smelling was Esau.

Esau Hated Jacob 07-05
========================


**Esau** hated **Jacob** because Jacob had stolen his **rights as oldest
son** and also **his blessing**. So he planned to kill Jacob after their
father died.

Translation Notes:
------------------

-   **rights as oldest son** - Jacob found a way to get the larger
    portion of their father's wealth that should have gone to Esau as
    the older son. See also note on
-   **his blessing** - Jacob also tricked their father into giving him
    the promise of extra prosperity that Isaac intended to give to Esau.
    See also note on

Isaac Sent Jacob Away 07-06
=============================


But **Rebekah** heard of **Esau’s plan**. So **she and Isaac sent
Jacob far away to live with her relatives**.

Translation Notes:
------------------

-   **Esau's plan** - Esau's plan was to kill Jacob after his father
    died.
-   **she and Isaac sent Jacob** – Rebekah wanted to protect Jacob from
    Esau so she talked to Isaac about sending Jacob away.
-   **far away to live with her relatives** - This was the same place
    where Rebekah was living when Abraham's servant got her to be Isaac's
    wife. To make this clear, you could add, “relatives in the same
    land where she used to live.” The land was to the east, several
    hundred miles away.
-   **her relatives** - This could also be translated as, “their
    relatives.” Since Abraham's brother was Rebekah's grandfather,
    her relatives were also Isaac's relatives.

Jacob Prospered 07-07
=======================


**Jacob** lived with **Rebekah's** relatives for many years. During
that time he married and had twelve sons and a daughter. **God** made
him very **wealthy**.

Translation Notes:
------------------

-   **wealthy** – This included money, large herds of animals and other
    possessions.

Jacob Returned Home 07-08
===========================


**After twenty years** away from his home in **Canaan**, **Jacob**
returned there with his family, his **servants**, and all his herds
of animals.

Translation Notes:
------------------

-   **after twenty years** - Jacob had lived for twenty years in the
    land where his mother was from. If that is not clear you could say,
    “After twenty years living in the land where his relatives were.”

Jacob Met Esau 07-09
======================


**Jacob** was very afraid because he thought **Esau** still wanted
to kill him. So he sent many herds of animals to Esau as a gift. The
**servants** who brought the animals said to Esau, “**Your servant,
Jacob**, is giving you these animals. He is coming soon.”

Translation Notes:
------------------

-   **your servant, Jacob** - Jacob was not actually Esau's servant. But
    Jacob told his servants to say this because he wanted to show Esau
    that he was coming to him humbly and respectfully, so that Esau
    would no longer be angry with him.

The Brothers Were Reunited 07-10
==================================


But **Esau** had already **forgiven** **Jacob**, and they were happy to
see each other again. Jacob then **lived peacefully** in **Canaan**. Then
**Isaac** died, and Jacob and Esau **buried him**. The **covenant**
**promises** **God** had promised to **Abraham** now **passed on from
Isaac to Jacob**.

*A Bible story from: Genesis 25:27-33:20*

Translation Notes:
------------------

-   **lived peacefully** - This refers to the fact that Esau and Jacob
    were not angry at each other and did not fight with each other.
-   **buried him** - This could mean that they dug a hole in the ground,
    placed Isaac's body in it, and covered the hole with dirt or stones.
    Or it could mean that they placed Isaac's body in a cave and covered
    the opening.
-   **covenant promises** - These were the promises that God made in his
    covenant with Abraham.
-   **passed on from Isaac to Jacob** - The promises went from Abraham
    to his son Isaac, and now to Isaac's son Jacob. Esau did not receive
    the promises. See also
-   *A Bible story from* - These references may be slightly different in
    some Bible translations.

Joseph, the Favorite Son 08-01
================================


Many years later, when **Jacob** was an old man, he **sent** his
**favorite son**, **Joseph**, to **check on** his **brothers** who were
**taking care of the herds**.

Translation Notes:
------------------

-   **sent** – This word means that Jacob told Joseph to go and Joseph
    went.
-   **favorite son** - This could be translated as, “the son he loved
    more than any of his other children.”
-   **check on** - This means that Joseph is to go and see if everything
    is all right with his brothers. Some languages might say something
    like, “to see his brothers' well-being.”
-   **brothers** - These were Joseph's older brothers.  -   **taking
care of the herds** – Since this was several days' journey
    away, it may be necessary to say, “who were far away taking
    care of.”

Joseph Was Sold as a Slave 08-02
==================================


**Joseph’s** brothers hated him because their father loved him most
and because Joseph had **dreamed** that he would be their ruler. When
Joseph **came to his brothers**, they **kidnapped** him and sold him to
some **slave traders**.

Translation Notes:
------------------

-   **came to his brothers** – Another way this could be translated is,
    “reached the place where his brothers were.”
-   **kidnapped** - They took him against his will. It was not right for
    them to do this.
-   **slave traders** - These were people who made a business of buying
    people from one owner and selling them as slaves to another owner.

The Brothers' Lie 08-03
=========================


Before **Joseph’s** brothers returned home, they tore Joseph’s
robe and dipped it in **goat's blood**. Then they showed the robe to
their father so he would think that a wild animal had killed Joseph.
**Jacob** was very sad.

Translation Notes:
------------------

-   **goat's blood** - The brothers wanted Jacob to think that the blood
    on the clothes was Joseph's blood.

Joseph in Egypt 08-04
=======================


The **slave** traders took **Joseph** to **Egypt**. Egypt was a large,
powerful country located along the **Nile River**. The slave traders sold
Joseph as a slave to a wealthy **government official**.  Joseph served
his master well, and **God** **blessed** Joseph.

Translation Notes:
------------------

-   **government official** - This was a person who was part of the
    Egyptian government. Another way to say this would be, “a leader
    in Egypt's government.”

Joseph in Prison 08-05
========================


His master’s wife **tried to sleep with Joseph**, but Joseph refused to
**sin against God** in this way. She became angry and falsely accused
Joseph so that he was arrested and sent to prison. Even in prison,
Joseph **remained faithful to God**, and God **blessed** him.

Translation Notes:
------------------

-   **tried to sleep with Joseph** – Another way to say this would be,
    “tried to seduce Joseph to have sex with her.” To “sleep with”
    is a way of expressing this in order not to be crude or offensive.
-   **sin against God** - It is against God's law for people to have sex
    if they are not married to each other. Joseph did not want to sin
    by disobeying God's law.
-   **remained faithful to God** - Another way to say this would be,
    “continued to obey God.”

Pharaoh's Dream 08-06
=======================


After two years, **Joseph** was still in prison, even though he was
**innocent**. One night, the **Pharaoh**, which is what the **Egyptians**
called their **kings**, had two **dreams** that **disturbed him
greatly**. None of **his advisors** could tell him the **meaning of
the dreams**.

Translation Notes:
------------------

-   **disturbed him greatly** – This means that the king felt very
    afraid and confused .
-   **his advisors** - These were men with special powers and knowledge
    who could sometimes tell what dreams meant. Some translations refer
    to them as, “wise men.”
-   **meaning of the dreams** - People in Egypt believed that dreams
    were messages from the gods telling them about what would happen in
    the future. God used Pharaoh's dreams to tell him what would happen.

Joseph Interpreted the Dream 08-07
====================================


**God** had given **Joseph** the ability to **interpret dreams**, so
**Pharaoh had Joseph brought to him** from the prison. Joseph interpreted
the dreams for him and said, “**God is going to send** seven years of
plentiful harvests, followed by seven years of **famine**.”

Translation Notes:
------------------

-   **interpret dreams** - To “interpret” is to tell what something
    means. So Joseph was able to tell people what their dreams meant.
-   **had Joseph brought to him** - Another way to say this would be,
    “ordered his servants to bring Joseph to him.”
-   **God is going to send** - God will cause the crops to grow well for
    seven years, and after that He will cause them to produce very little
    food so that the people and animals will not have enough to eat.
-   **famine** - The gardens and fields would produce so little food
    that people and animals would not have enough to eat.

Joseph Ruled Egypt 08-08
==========================


**Pharaoh** was so **impressed with Joseph** that he appointed him to
be the **second most powerful man** in all of **Egypt**!

Translation Notes:
------------------

-   **impressed with** - Pharaoh was amazed by Joseph's wisdom and felt
    respect for him; he trusted Joseph to make wise decisions that
    would benefit the people. It may be clearer to say, “impressed
    with Joseph's wisdom.”
-   **second most powerful man** - Pharaoh made Joseph a very powerful
    and important ruler over all of Egypt. Only Pharaoh was more powerful
    and important than Joseph.

Joseph Stored Up Food 08-09
=============================


**Joseph** told the people to **store up large amounts of food** during
the seven years of good harvests. Then Joseph sold the food to the people
when the seven years of **famine** came so they would have enough to eat.

Translation Notes:
------------------

-   **store up large amounts of food** - They took food from the
    abundant harvests to the cities and stored it there. The food then
    belonged to Pharaoh.
-   **famine** - See how you translated this in

The Famine 08-10
==================


**The famine was severe** not only in **Egypt**, but also in **Canaan**
where **Jacob** and his family lived.

Translation Notes:
------------------

-   **Egypt, but also Canaan** – For some languages it may be clearer or
    more natural to say, “the country of Egypt, but also the land
    of Canaan.”
-   **The famine was severe** - The famine was very bad. There was very
    little food and many people outside of Egypt were starving.

The Brothers Bought Food 08-11
================================


So **Jacob** sent **his older sons** to **Egypt** to buy food. The
brothers **did not recognize Joseph** when they stood before him to buy
food. But Joseph recognized them.

Translation Notes:
------------------

-   **his older sons** - These were Joseph's older brothers who had sold
    him into slavery.
-   **did not recognize Joseph** - They did not know that the man was
    Joseph, because now Joseph was much older than when they last saw him,
    and he was dressed as an Egyptian ruler.

Joseph Met His Brothers 08-12
===============================


After **testing his brothers** to see **if they had changed**, **Joseph**
said to them, “I am your brother, Joseph! **Do not be afraid**. You
tried to do **evil** when you sold me as a **slave**, but **God** used
the **evil for good**! Come and live in **Egypt** so I can provide for
you and your families.”

Translation Notes:
------------------

-   **testing his brothers** - Joseph placed his older brothers in a
    difficult situation to see if they would protect their youngest
    brother, or treat him as badly as they had treated Joseph. When they
    protected their youngest brother, Joseph knew they had changed.
-   **if they had changed** - Another way to say this would be, “if they
    were different than they used to be.” Years ago Joseph's brothers
    sold him into slavery. Joseph wanted to find out if they would now
    do what was right.
-   **do not be afraid** - Another way to say this would be, “You do not
    need to fear any punishment from me.” Joseph's brothers were afraid
    because they had greatly wronged Joseph and now as a great ruler he
    had the power to punish them. Joseph could refuse to sell them food,
    or even put them in prison or kill them.
-   **evil for good** - Joseph's brothers did an evil thing when they
    sold Joseph as a slave and he was taken to Egypt. But God allowed this
    so that Joseph could save thousands of people from starving during
    the famine, including his own family. This was a very good thing.

Joseph Was Alive 08-13
========================


When **Joseph's** brothers returned home and told their father, **Jacob**,
that Joseph was still alive, he was very happy.

Translation Notes:
------------------

**

Jacob Went to Egypt 08-14
===========================


**Even though Jacob was an old man, he moved to Egypt** with all of his
family, and they all lived there. **Before Jacob died**, he **blessed**
each of his sons.

Translation Notes:
------------------

-   **Even though Jacob was an old man, he moved to Egypt** - Egypt was
    a great distance away from Canaan, and it would have been difficult
    for an elderly man to walk or ride a cart that far.
-   **Before Jacob died** - Jacob died in Egypt. He did not get to
    return to Canaan, the land God had promised to give to him and
    his descendants.

The Twelve Sons 08-15
=======================


The **covenant** **promises** that **God** gave to **Abraham** were
**passed on to** **Isaac**, then to **Jacob**, and then to Jacob’s
twelve sons and their families. The **descendants** of the twelve sons
became the **twelve tribes of Israel**.

*A Bible story from: Genesis 37-50*

Translation Notes:
------------------

-   **covenant promises** - Long ago God made an agreement with Abraham
    and promised him that he would give him many descendants; they
    would possess the land of Canaan and become a great nation. God also
    promised that all peoples would be blessed through Abraham's line.
    See also
-   **passed on to** - Another way to say this would be, “passed down
    to” or, “given to” or, “applied to.” God's promise to
    Abraham was also for Abraham's children, grandchildren and all the
    rest of his descendants. See also
-   **twelve tribes of Israel** - God had promised Abraham, Isaac and
    Jacob that their descendants would become a great nation. God later
    changed Jacob's name to Israel. The descendants of Jacob's 12 sons
    became 12 great tribes. These 12 tribes made up the ancient nation
    called Israel, which was named by Jacob's new name.
-   *A Bible story from* - These references may be slightly different in
    some Bible translations.

The Israelites 09-01
======================


After **Joseph** died, all of his relatives stayed in **Egypt**. They
and their **descendants** continued to live there for many years and
had many children. They were called the **Israelites**.

Translation Notes:
------------------

**

A New Pharaoh 09-02
=====================


After hundreds of years, the number of **Israelites** had become very
large. The **Egyptians** no longer remembered **Joseph** and all he had
done to help them. They became afraid of the Israelites because there
were so many of them. So the **Pharaoh** who was ruling Egypt at that
time **made the Israelites slaves** to the Egyptians.

Translation Notes:
------------------

-   **Pharaoh** – “Pharaoh” is an Egyptian word that refers to their
    king. This Pharaoh was probably the son of a former Pharaoh who had
    died, who may have been a descendant of the Pharaoh that Joseph knew.
-   **made the Israelites slaves** - That is, “forced the Israelites to
    do hard labor against their will and treated them very harshly.”

Hard Labor 09-03
==================


The **Egyptians** forced the **Israelites** to build many buildings
and even whole cities. The hard work made their lives **miserable**,
but **God blessed them**, and they had even more children.

Translation Notes:
------------------

-   **miserable** – This means that they suffered terribly because of
    how harshly they were treated and how hard they were forced to work.
    They also felt very discouraged.
-   **God blessed them** - God took care of them, helping them endure
    the severe treatment and even caused them to become more numerous
    by giving them children.

Kill the Baby Boys 09-04
==========================


**Pharaoh saw** that the **Israelites** were having many babies, so he
ordered his people to kill all Israelite baby boys by throwing them into
the **Nile River**.

Translation Notes:
------------------

-   **saw** – Another way to say this would be, “realized” or,
“knew.”

The Birth of Moses 09-05
==========================


A certain **Israelite** woman gave birth to a baby boy. She and her
husband hid the baby for **as long as they could**.

Translation Notes:
------------------

-   **as long as they could** - They hid the baby from the Egyptians
    until it became too difficult to keep him safely hidden in their home.

Moses in a Basket 09-06
=========================


When the boy's parents could no longer hide him, they put him in a
**floating basket among the reeds along the edge of the Nile River**
in order to save him from being killed. His older sister watched to see
what would happen to him.

Translation Notes:
------------------

-   **

Pharaoh's Daughter 09-07
==========================


A daughter of **Pharaoh** saw the basket and looked inside. When she saw
the baby, she **took him as her own son**. She hired an **Israelite**
woman **to nurse him** without realizing the woman was the baby’s
own mother. When the child was old enough that he no longer needed
his mother's milk, she returned him to Pharaoh’s daughter, who named
him **Moses**.

Translation Notes:
------------------

-   **took him as her own son** - She was a princess. When she made him
    her son, he became a prince of Egypt.
-   **to nurse him** - Another way to say this would be, “to breastfeed
    him.”

An Egyptian Beat a Slave 09-08
================================


One day, when **Moses** had **grown up**, he saw an **Egyptian**
beating an **Israelite** **slave**. Moses tried to **save** his **fellow
Israelite**.

Translation Notes:
------------------

-   **grown up** - Another way to say this would be, “grown into a
man.” -   **fellow Israelite** - This phrase refers to the Israelite
slave.
    The word “fellow” here indicates that Moses was also an Israelite.
    Although the daughter of the Egyptian Pharaoh raised Moses, Moses
    remembered that he was really an Israelite.

Moses Killed an Egyptian 09-09
================================


When **Moses** thought nobody would see, he killed the **Egyptian**
and buried his body. But someone saw what Moses had done.

Translation Notes:
------------------

-   **

Moses Fled from Egypt 09-10
=============================


When **Pharaoh** heard what **Moses** had done, he tried to kill
him. Moses ran away from **Egypt** to the **wilderness** where he would
be safe from Pharaoh's soldiers.

Translation Notes:
------------------

-   **wilderness** - The wilderness was a large area that was rocky and
    dry. The land there was not good for growing food and few people
    lived there.

Moses in the Wilderness 09-11
===============================


**Moses** became a **shepherd** in the **wilderness** far away from
**Egypt**. He married a woman from that place and had two sons.

Translation Notes:
------------------

-   **wilderness** - See how you translated this in

The Burning Bush 09-12
========================


One day while **Moses** was **taking care of his sheep**, he saw a bush
that was on fire. But the **bush did not burn up**. Moses went towards
the bush to be able to see it better. As he approached the burning bush,
**the voice of God said**, “Moses, **take off your shoes**. You are
standing on **holy ground**.”

Translation Notes:
------------------

-   **taking care of his sheep** - This means he was doing the work of a
    shepherd to guide the sheep to grass and water, and to protect them.
    It could be translated as, “tending the sheep.”
-   **bush did not burn up** - God made the bush full of fire, but the
    fire did not damage the bush.
-   **the voice of God said** - This could be translated as, “God said
    out loud.” Moses heard God speak, but he did not see God.
-   **take off your shoes** - God wanted him to take off his shoes to
    show that he greatly respected God. To make clear the reason for
    this, you could say, “take off your shoes, because you are on
    holy ground.”
-   **holy ground** - It was holy in the sense that God set it apart
    from the ordinary land and made it to be a special place where He
    would reveal Himself.

God Sent Moses to Egypt 09-13
===============================


**God** said, “I have seen the **suffering of my people**. I will send
you to **Pharaoh** so that you can **bring the Israelites out of their
slavery in Egypt**. I will give them the land of **Canaan**, the land
I **promised** to **Abraham**, **Isaac**, and **Jacob**.”

Translation Notes:
------------------

-   **suffering of my people** - This could be translated as, “the very
    harsh treatment that my people are experiencing. Some languages
    might translate this as, “how the Egyptians are giving my people
    terrible pain.”
-   **my people** - This refers to the Israelites. God had made a
    covenant with Abraham and his descendants that He would bless them and
    make them into a great nation. Through this covenant, the Israelites
    became God's own people.
-   **bring … out of their slavery in Egypt** - This can be translated
    as, “set them free from being slaves in Egypt” or, “bring them
    out of Egypt where they are now slaves.”

The Name of God 09-14
=======================


**Moses** asked, “What if **the people** want to know who sent me,
what should I say?” **God** said, “**I AM WHO I AM**. Tell them,
‘**I AM** has sent me to you.’ Also tell them, 'I am **Yahweh**,
the God of your ancestors **Abraham**, **Isaac**, and **Jacob**.' This
is **my name** forever.”

Translation Notes:
------------------

-   **the people** - See “my people” in -   **I AM WHO I AM** -
This description shows that God can only be
    defined by himself, not by anything else that we know of, and he
    cannot be compared to anyone else.
-   **I AM** - This name emphasizes that God is the only one who has
    always lived and always will live.
-   **my name** - The name that God told Moses and all of Israel to use
    for him is “Yahweh,” which is related to “I AM” and appears
    to mean, “HE IS.”

Aaron Helped Moses 09-15
==========================


**Moses was afraid and did not want to go** to **Pharaoh** because he
thought he could not speak well, so **God** sent **Moses’ brother,
Aaron**, to help him. God warned Moses and Aaron that Pharaoh would
be **stubborn**.

*A Bible story from: Exodus 1-4*

Translation Notes:
------------------

-   **was afraid and did not want to go** - Moses knew that Pharaoh
    wanted to kill him, and he did not believe that he could do what
    God wanted him to do.
-   **Moses' brother, Aaron** - Aaron was Moses's actual brother from
    his Israelite mother and father. Aaron would have been at least
    several years older than Moses.
-   **stubborn** - This means the Pharaoh would refuse to obey God. You
    may also want to add, “stubborn and refuse to listen .”
-   *A Bible story from* - These references may be slightly different in
    some Bible translations.

Let My People Go! 10-01
=========================


**Moses** and **Aaron** went **to Pharaoh**. They said, “This is what
the **God of Israel** says, ‘**Let my people go**!’” Pharaoh did
not **listen to** them. Instead of letting the **Israelites** go free,
he forced them to work even harder!

Translation Notes:
------------------

-   **to Pharaoh** – It may be clearer to say, “to Pharaoh's palace to
    talk to him.”
-   **God of Israel** - This could be translated as, “God, who chose the
    Israelites to be his people” or, “God, who rules the people of
    Israel” or, “the God whom the Israelites worship.”
-   **Let My people go** – Another way to say this would be, “Allow My
    people to go free” or, “Free My people to leave Egypt.”
-   **my people** - See “my people” in -   **listen to** – This
could be translated as “heed” or, “obey.”

Pharaoh Refused to Obey 10-02
===============================


**Pharaoh** kept refusing to let **the people** go, so **God** sent
**ten terrible plagues** on **Egypt**.  Through these plagues, God showed
Pharaoh that he is more powerful than Pharaoh and **all of Egypt's gods**.

Translation Notes:
------------------

-   **the people** - This refers to the people of Israel, also called,
    “the Israelites.”
-   **ten terrible plagues** - A plague is something very bad or
    terrible that happens to someone or something. A plague usually
    refers to something that affects many people or happens over a
    large geographic area. Another word for “plague” would be
    “disaster.”
-   **all of Egypt's gods** - It may be more clear to say, “all the gods
    that the Egyptian people worshiped.” The people of Egypt worshiped
    many different false gods. These false gods were either spirit beings
    that the God of Israel created, or they did not actually exist.

The Water Became Blood 10-03
==============================


**God turned the Nile River into blood**, but **Pharaoh** still would
not let the **Israelites** go.

Translation Notes:
------------------

-   **turned the Nile River into blood** - Some languages may need to
    say, “turned the water in the Nile River into blood.” Instead of
    water in the river there was blood, so the fish died and the people
    had no water to drink.

The Frogs 10-04
=================


**God sent frogs all over Egypt**.  **Pharaoh** **begged** **Moses**
to take away the frogs. But after all the frogs died, Pharaoh **hardened
his heart** and would not let the **Israelites** leave Egypt.

Translation Notes:
------------------

-   **God sent frogs all over Egypt** - This could be translated as,
    “God caused many frogs to appear throughout Egypt.”
-   **hardened his heart** - He became stubborn again and refused to
    obey God.

The Gnats and the Flies 10-05
===============================


So **God sent a plague** of **gnats**. Then he sent a plague of **flies**.
**Pharaoh** called **Moses** and **Aaron** and told them that if they
stopped the plague, the **Israelites** could leave Egypt. When Moses
prayed, God removed all the flies from **Egypt**. But Pharaoh **hardened
his heart** and would not let the people go free.

Translation Notes:
------------------

-   **God sent a plague** – This could be translated as, “God caused
    there to be a plague” or, “God caused a plague  to come over
    the land of Egypt.”
-   **gnats** - These were tiny, biting insects flying in large swarms,
    annoying and landing on all the people and animals of Egypt.
-   **flies** - These were much bigger flying insects that were both
    annoying and destructive. There were so many of these flies that
    they covered everything, even filling the Egyptians' houses.
-   **hardened his heart** - See note in

The Animals Died 10-06
========================


Next, **God** caused all the farm animals that belonged to the
**Egyptians** to get sick and die. But **Pharaoh’s heart was hardened**,
and he would not let the **Israelites** go.

Translation Notes:
------------------

-   **farm animals** - This refers to large animals that the Egyptians
    used to help them in their work, such as horses, donkeys, camels,
    cattle, sheep, and goats.
-   **heart was hardened** - See note in

The Painful Sores 10-07
=========================


Then **God** told **Moses** to throw ashes into the air in front
of **Pharaoh**. When he did, painful skin sores appeared on the
**Egyptians**, but not on the **Israelites**. **God hardened Pharaoh's
heart**, and Pharaoh would not let the Israelites go free.

Translation Notes:
------------------

-   **God hardened Pharaoh's heart** - God caused Pharaoh to continue to
    be stubborn. See also note in

The Hail 10-08
================


**After that**, **God sent hail** that destroyed most of the crops
in **Egypt** and killed anybody who went outside.  **Pharaoh** called
**Moses** and **Aaron** and told them, “I have **sinned**. **You may
go**.” So Moses **prayed**, and the hail stopped falling from the sky.

Translation Notes:
------------------

-   **After that** - This means, after God caused the painful sores to
    appear on the Egyptians' skin.
-   **God sent hail** - God caused hail to fall from the sky.  -
**hail** - Hail is like chunks of ice that fall down from the clouds
    as rain does. These chunks can be very small or very large. The
    larger ones will hurt or kill whatever they fall on.
-   **You may go** - The word “you” refers to Moses, Aaron, and the
    Israelites.

Pharaoh's Hard Heart 10-09
============================


But **Pharaoh** **sinned** again and **hardened his heart**. He would
not let the **Israelites** go free.

Translation Notes:
------------------

-   **hardened his heart** - See note in

The Locusts 10-10
===================


So **God** caused **swarms of locusts** to come over **Egypt**. These
**locusts** ate all the crops that the **hail** had not destroyed.

Translation Notes:
------------------

-   **swarms of locusts** - Locusts are grasshoppers that fly together
    in swarms, or large groups, and that can destroy large areas of all
    kinds of plants and food crops by eating them.
-   **hail** - Hail is like chunks of ice that fall down from the clouds
    as rain does.

The Darkness 10-11
====================


Then **God sent darkness that lasted for three days**. It was so dark
that the **Egyptians** could not leave their houses. But there was light
where the **Israelites** lived.

Translation Notes:
------------------

-   **God sent darkness** - God caused darkness to cover or spread over
    most of Egypt. In other words, God took away the light from this
    part of Egypt.
-   **darkness that lasted for three days** - This darkness was darker
    than ordinary nighttime darkness, and it continued to be totally
    dark for three whole days.

Pharaoh Refused to Listen 10-12
=================================


Even after **these nine plagues**, **Pharaoh** still refused to let the
**Israelites** go free.  **Since Pharaoh would not listen**, **God**
planned to send one last plague. **This would change Pharaoh’s mind**.

*A Bible story from: Exodus 5-10*

Translation Notes:
------------------

-   **these nine plagues** - This means, “these nine disasters that God
    had caused.”
-   **Since Pharaoh would not listen** - This could be translated as,
    “Since Pharaoh would not do what God was telling him to do” or,
    “Since Pharaoh refused to obey God.”
-   **This would change Pharaoh's mind** - Another way to say this would
    be, “This last plague would cause Pharaoh to change how he thought
    about God and as a result he would let the Israelites go free.”
-   *A Bible story from* - These references may be slightly different in
    some Bible translations.

Firstborn Males Would Die 11-01
=================================


**God** warned **Pharaoh** that if he did not let the **Israelites**
go, then he would kill all the **firstborn males of both people and
animals**. When Pharaoh heard this he still refused to **believe**
and **obey** God.

Translation Notes:
------------------

-   **the firstborn males of both people and animals** - This could be
    translated as, “the eldest son in every family and the first male
    offspring of any of their animals.”

The Sacrifice 11-02
=====================


**God provided** a way to **save** the firstborn **son** of anyone
who **believed** in him.  Each family had to choose a **perfect lamb**
and kill it.

Translation Notes:
------------------

-   **God provided** – God is the only one who could provide the way to
    save the Israelites' sons from death.
-   **perfect lamb** - That is, “a young sheep or goat that had no
    blemishes or defects.”

Blood on the Door 11-03
=========================


**God** told the **Israelites** to put some of the **lamb's** **blood**
around the door of their house, and to roast the meat and eat it quickly,
along with bread that was **made without yeast**. He also told them to
be ready to leave **Egypt** **when they ate**.

Translation Notes:
------------------

-   **made without yeast** – Yeast is something that is mixed into bread
    dough to make bread rise as it cooks. This could be translated as,
    “made without something that would make it rise.” Making the
    bread with yeast would have taken much longer, so cooking the bread
    without yeast was a way to be prepared to leave Egypt quickly.
-   **when they ate** – This means they needed to be prepared to leave
    before they started to eat.

The Passover Meal 11-04
=========================


The **Israelites** did everything just as **God** had commanded them to
do. In the middle of the night, God went throughout **Egypt** killing
**every firstborn son**.

Translation Notes:
------------------

-   **every firstborn son** - This means every firstborn son of families
    who had not made the blood sacrifice, that is, the Egyptians. To
    make this clear you may want to add, “Every Egyptian firstborn
    son” (since all the Israelite families had put the blood on their
    doorposts).

Saved by the Blood 11-05
==========================


All the houses of the **Israelites** had **blood** around the doors,
so **God** **passed over** those houses. Everybody inside them was
safe. **They were saved because of the lamb's blood**.

Translation Notes:
------------------

-   **passed over** - This means that God passed by those houses and did
    not stop to kill anyone there. This phrase became the name of the
    Jewish festival, “Passover.”
-   **They were saved** - God did not kill their firstborn son.  -
**because of the lamb's blood** - This could be translated as,
    “because the lamb's blood was on their door.” God saw that
    they had killed their lamb as he had commanded, so he did not kill
    their son.

Death of the Firstborn 11-06
==============================


But the **Egyptians** **did not believe God or obey his commands**. So
God **did not pass over** their houses. God killed every one of the
Egyptians' firstborn sons.

Translation Notes:
------------------

-   **did not believe God or obey his commands** – In some languages it
    may be more natural or clear to say, “did not believe God and so
    they did not obey his commands.”
-   **did not pass over** - He did not pass by their houses. Rather he
    stopped at each house and killed their eldest son.

Sorrow in Egypt 11-07
=======================


Every **Egyptian** firstborn male died, **from the firstborn of the
prisoner in jail, to the firstborn of Pharaoh**.  Many people in **Egypt**
were crying and wailing because of their deep sadness.

Translation Notes:
------------------

-   **from the firstborn of the prisoner in jail, to the firstborn of
    Pharaoh** - This is a way of saying that everyone's firstborn son
    died–from the son of the least important person to the son of the
    most important person, and everyone in between.

Go Away! 11-08
================


That same night, **Pharaoh called for Moses** and **Aaron and said**,
“Take the **Israelites** and leave **Egypt** immediately!” The
**Egyptian** people also urged the Israelites to leave immediately.

*A Bible story from: Exodus 11:1-12:32*

Translation Notes:
------------------

-   **called for** – This means that Pharaoh told his servants to tell
    Moses and Aaron to come to him.
-   **and said** – Pharaoh said the following words to Moses and Aaron
    after they came to him. In some languages this would be translated
    as, “and said to them,” or, “After they came, Pharaoh said
    to them.”
-   *A Bible story from* - These references may be slightly different in
    some Bible translations.

Israel Left Egypt 12-01
=========================


The **Israelites** were very happy to leave **Egypt**. **They were no
longer slaves**, and they were **going** to the **Promised Land**! The
**Egyptians** gave the Israelites whatever they asked for, even gold
and silver and other valuable things. Some people from other nations
**believed** in **God** and went along with the Israelites as they
left Egypt.

Translation Notes:
------------------

-   **They were no longer slaves** - This could be translated as, “They
    were not slaves anymore.”
-   **going** – Some languages may use a more specific word like
    “traveling” since they would be going a long distance to the
    Promised Land.
-   **Promised Land** - This is the land that God had promised that he
    would give to Abraham's descendants.

God Went before Israel 12-02
==============================


**God** led them with a **tall pillar of cloud** that went ahead of them
during the day, and which became a **tall pillar of fire** at night. God
was always with them and **guided them** as they traveled. All they had
to do was follow him.

Translation Notes:
------------------

-   **tall pillar of cloud** - This could be translated as, “a tall
    cloud” or, “a cloud shaped like a pillar.”
-   **tall pillar of fire** - This was a column of fire that hung or
    floated in the air in front of the Israelites.
-   **guided them** - God showed them the way by making the pillar move
    along in front of them so they could follow it.

Pharaoh Changed His Mind 12-03
================================


**After a short time**, **Pharaoh** and his people **changed their
minds** and wanted the **Israelites** to be their **slaves** again.
**God** caused Pharaoh to be stubborn so that people would see he is
the One True God, and understand that he, Yahweh, is more powerful than
Pharaoh and his **gods**.

Translation Notes:
------------------

-   **After a short time** – Probably at least two days had gone by. For
    that to be clear, it may be translated as, “After a few days” or,
    “A few days after the Israelites left Egypt.”
-   **changed their minds** - This phrase means, “began to think
    differently than they had before.” Some languages may not have
    this same expression, and will express the meaning in a direct way.

Pharaoh Chased Israel 12-04
=============================


So **Pharaoh** and his army chased after the **Israelites** to **make
them their slaves again**. When the Israelites saw the **Egyptian**
army coming, they realized **they were trapped between Pharaoh's army
and the Red Sea**. They were very afraid and cried out, “**Why did we
leave Egypt**? We are going to die!”

Translation Notes:
------------------

-   **they were trapped between…Red Sea** - Another way to say this
    would be, “there was nowhere they could go to escape since the
    Egyptians were behind them and the Red Sea was in front of them.”
-   **Why did we leave Egypt?** – This means, “We should not have left
    Egypt!” They were not really asking for reasons. Because they were
    afraid, in this moment they were wishing they had not left Egypt .

God Will Fight for You 12-05
==============================


**Moses** told the **Israelites**, “**Stop being afraid**! **God will
fight for you today and save you**.” Then God told Moses, “Tell the
people to **move** toward the **Red Sea**.”

Translation Notes:
------------------

-   **God will fight for you today and save you** - Another way to say
    this would be, “Today God will defeat the Egyptians for you and
    keep them from harming you.”
-   **move** – Some languages will be more specific and say, “walk.”

Darkness over the Egyptians 12-06
===================================


Then **God** moved the **pillar of cloud** and placed it between the
**Israelites** and the **Egyptians** so the Egyptians **could not see**
the Israelites.

Translation Notes:
------------------

-   **pillar of cloud** – See how you translated this phrase in -
**could not see** - The cloud pillar was so large and thick that the
    Egyptians could no longer see any of the Israelites.

Moses Divided the Sea 12-07
=============================


**God** told **Moses** to **raise his hand over the sea** and divide
the waters. Then God caused wind to push the water in the sea to the
left and the right, so that a path formed through the sea.

Translation Notes:
------------------

-   **raise his hand over the sea** - This could be translated as, “held
    out his hand over the sea”. This was a gesture to show that God
    was doing this miracle through Moses.

Israel Crossed the Sea 12-08
==============================


The **Israelites** **marched** through the sea on dry ground **with a
wall of water on either side of them**.

Translation Notes:
------------------

-   **marched** - This can be translated as, “walked” or, “went.”
-   **with a wall of water on either side of them** - This could be
    translated as, “and the water on both sides of them stood up tall
    and straight like a wall.”

Egypt Pursued Israel 12-09
============================


Then **God** moved the cloud up and out of the way so that the
**Egyptians** could see the **Israelites** escaping.  The Egyptians
decided to chase after them.

Translation Notes:
------------------

-   **

God Fought for Israel 12-10
=============================


So they followed the **Israelites** onto the **path through the sea**,
but **God** caused the **Egyptians** **to panic** and caused their
**chariots** to **get stuck**. They shouted, “Run away! God is fighting
for the Israelites!”

Translation Notes:
------------------

-   **path through the sea** - This was the dry strip of land across the
    bottom of the sea, with a wall of water on each side.
-   **to panic** – This could be translated as, “to get fearful and
    confused.”
-   **get stuck** - The chariots could no longer move.

The Egyptians Drowned 12-11
=============================


After the **Israelites** all **made it safely to the other side** of the
sea, **God** told **Moses** to **stretch out his arm again**. When he
obeyed, the **water fell on the Egyptian army** and **returned to its
normal place**. **The whole Egyptian army** drowned.

Translation Notes:
------------------

-   **made it safely to the other side** – This could be translated as,
    “walked safely to the other side” or, “arrived safely on the
    other side” or, “walked to the other side and were safe from
    the Egyptians and the sea.”
-   **stretch out his arm again** - This could be translated as, “lift
    his arm over the sea again” or, as a direct command, as in, “God
    told Moses, 'Stretch out your arm again.'”
-   **returned to its normal place** - This could be translated as,
    “covered the place again where the path had been,” or “filled
    the whole sea again” or, “went back to where it was before God
    separated it.”
-   **The whole Egyptian army** - This could be translated as, “everyone
    in Egypt's army.”

Israel Believed God 12-12
===========================


When the **Israelites** saw that the **Egyptians** were dead, they
**trusted in God** and **believed** that **Moses** was **a prophet
of God**.

Translation Notes:
------------------

-   **trusted in God** - In other words, the people now trusted that God
    was powerful and could protect them.

Israel Rejoiced 12-13
=======================


The **Israelites** also **rejoiced with much excitement** because **God**
had **saved** them **from death and slavery**! Now they were **free to
serve** God. The Israelites sang many songs to celebrate their new freedom
and to **praise God** because he saved them from the **Egyptian** army.

Translation Notes:
------------------

-   **rejoiced with much excitement** - This could be translated as,
    “were very happy and they showed it enthusiastically” or,
    “showed it with their whole hearts” or, “with all their
    strength.”
-   **from death and slavery** - This could be translated as, “from
    being killed or made slaves by the Egyptians.”
-   **free to serve** - God freed, or rescued, the Israelites from being
    slaves in Egypt so that they could serve him.
-   **praise God** - In some languages this could be translated as,
    “lift up God's name” or, “say that God is great.”

An Annual Feast 12-14
=======================


**God** commanded the **Israelites** to celebrate **the Passover**
every year in order to **remember how God gave them victory over** the
**Egyptians** and rescued them from being **slaves**. They celebrated
by killing a **perfect lamb**, eating it with **unleavened bread**.

*A Bible story from: Exodus 12:33-15:21*

Translation Notes:
------------------

-   **the Passover** - This could be translated as, “the Passover
    activities” or, “the Passover celebration” or, “the Passover
    meal.”
-   **remember how God gave them victory over** – This could be
    translated as, “regularly remind themselves of how God defeated.”
    The word “remember” here doesn't just mean to not forget; it
    also means to formally commemorate something.
-   **perfect lamb** - The word “perfect” here refers to a lamb
with no
    disease or anything else wrong with it. Another way to say this
    might be, “a completely healthy and well-formed lamb.”
-   **unleavened bread** - This is another way to say, “bread that was
    made without yeast.”
-   *A Bible story from* - These references may be slightly different in
    some Bible translations.

The Mountain at Sinai 13-01
=============================


After **God** led the **Israelites** through the **Red Sea**, he led
them through the wilderness to a mountain called **Sinai**. This was the
same mountain where **Moses** had seen the **burning bush**. The people
**set up their tents** at the **base of the mountain**.

Translation Notes:
------------------

-   **burning bush** - Before Moses returned to Egypt, God had spoken to
    him from a shrub that was on fire, but that was not burned up by
    the fire. See
-   **set up their tents** - The Israelites had to travel a great
    distance from Egypt to the Promised Land. So they took tents with them
    so that they could set them up as shelters and sleep in them along the
    way. Some languages could translate this as, “hung their tents.”
-   **base of the mountain** – This could be translated as, “bottom of
    the mountain.” This refers to the area of land that is located
    next to the place where the ground starts to slant upward to form
    a mountain.

God Called Israel 13-02
=========================


**God** said to **Moses** and the people of **Israel**, “If you
will **obey** me and **keep my covenant**, **you will be my prized
possession**, a **kingdom of priests**, and a **holy nation**.”

Translation Notes:
------------------

-   **keep my covenant** - This could be translated as, “do what my
    covenant requires you to do.” Obeying and keeping the covenant are
    not two different things. One way to make this clear would be to say,
    “obey me by keeping my covenant.” God will soon tell them what
    his covenant requires.
-   **my prized possession** - This could be translated as, “You will be
    my possession that I value most” or, “You will be the people
    that I treasure more than any other group of people” or, “You
    will be my own precious people.”
-   **You will be…a kingdom of priests** - This could be translated as,
    “I will be your king and you will be like priests.” The Israelites
    were supposed to teach the other nations about God and be a mediator
    between God and the nations just as there were priests in the nation
    of Israel to go between God and the Israelites.

Moses Met God 13-03
=====================


**Three days later**, after the people had **prepared themselves
spiritually**, **God** came down on top of **Mount Sinai** with thunder,
lightning, smoke, and a **loud trumpet blast**. **Only Moses was allowed
to go up** the mountain.

Translation Notes:
------------------

-   **Three days later** - In other words, three days after they arrived
    at Mount Sinai and God first spoke to them.
-   **prepared themselves spiritually** - This refers to ceremonial
    cleansing in preparation to meet with God. This could be translated
    as, “got ready to meet with God” or, “prepared themselves to
    meet with God.”
-   **loud trumpet blast** - This could be translated as, “and a loud
    sound came from a horn”, or “and a horn was blown and it made
    a loud sound” or, “and they heard the loud sound of a horn
    blowing.” Trumpets were made out of ram's horns. They were used that
    day to call the people to gather at the mountain and meet with God.
-   **Only Moses was allowed to go up** - This could be translated as,
    “God permitted Moses to go up, but he did not permit anyone else
    to go up.”

I Am Your God 13-04
=====================


**Then God gave them the covenant and said**, “I am **Yahweh, your
God**, **who saved you from slavery** in **Egypt**. Do not **worship**
other **gods**.”

Translation Notes:
------------------

-   **Then God gave them the covenant and said** - What God says next is
    the content of the covenant, that is, he tells the people the things
    that they must obey. This could be translated as, “Then God told
    them His covenant. He said” or, “Then God made this covenant
    with them:”
-   **Yahweh your God** - In some languages it might be more natural to
    change the order and say “your God Yahweh.” Make sure it does
    not sound like the Israelites had more than one God. It should be
    clear that Yahweh is the only God. Another way to translate this
    would be, “Yahweh, who is your God” or, “your God, whose name
    is Yahweh.”
-   **who saved you from slavery** - This could be translated as, “I
    freed you from slavery.”

The Commandments 13-05
========================


“Do not make **idols** and do not **worship** them, because **I,
Yahweh, am a jealous God**. **Do not use my name in a disrespectful
way**. Be sure to keep the **Sabbath day** **holy**. That is, do all
your work in six days, for the **seventh day** is a day for you to rest
and **to remember me**.”

Translation Notes:
------------------

- -   **I, Yahweh, am a jealous God** - This could be translated as, “I,
    Yahweh, will be angry if you worship or honor anything besides
    me.” God strongly desires that his people love, serve, and obey
    Him more than anything or anyone else. He must be the only master
    of their lives.
-   **Do not use my name in a disrespectful way** - This could be
    translated as, “Do not talk about me in a way that does not show
    respect and honor” or, “Talk about me in a way that gives me
    proper respect and honor.”
-   **seventh day** - To translate this, it is best to use the number
     rather than give the name of a specific day of the week.
-   **to remember me** - This could be translated as, “to keep me in
    mind” or, “to honor me.”

More Commandments 13-06
=========================


“**Honor** your father and your mother. Do not murder. **Do not commit
adultery**. **Do not steal**. **Do not lie**. Do not desire to have your
neighbor’s wife, his house, or anything that belongs to him.”

Translation Notes:
------------------

- -   **Do not commit adultery** - This could be translated as, “Do not
    have sexual relations with someone else's spouse” or, “Do not
    have marital relations with another man's wife or another woman's
    husband.” Be sure to translate this in a way that doesn't offend
    or embarrass people. Languages often have an indirect, polite way
    of saying this, such as, “Do not sleep with.”
-   **Do not lie** - This means, “Do not say false things about other
    people.”

The Stone Tablets 13-07
=========================


Then **God** wrote **these Ten Commandments** on two **stone tablets**
and gave them to **Moses**. **God also gave** many other laws and rules
**to follow**. If the people **obeyed** these **laws**, God **promised**
that he would **bless** and protect them. If they **disobeyed** them,
God would **punish them**.

Translation Notes:
------------------

-   **these Ten Commandments** - This refers to the commands God gave to
    Moses for the Israelites to obey. They are listed in frames and
-   **stone tablets** - These were flat pieces of stone.  -   **God
also gave** - This can be translated as, “God also told them.” -
**to follow** - This can be translated as, “that they must obey” or,
    “that they must keep.”

The Tent of Meeting 13-08
===========================


**God** also gave the **Israelites a detailed description** of a tent he
wanted them to make. **It was called** the **Tent of Meeting**, and it
had two rooms, separated by a large curtain. Only the **high priest**
was allowed to go into **the room behind the curtain**, because **God
lived there**.

Translation Notes:
------------------

-   **a detailed description** - This could be translated as, “God
    described it in detail” or, “God told them exactly how He wanted
    them to make it.”
-   **It was called** - This could be translated as, “They called it”
    or, “Moses called it.”
-   **the room behind the curtain** - This room was hidden by the
    curtain. Some languages would call this room, “the room in front
    of the curtain.”
-   **God lived there** - If this phrase would lead people to think that
    God was limited to living in the tent, here are some ways of
    translating it: “God was there” or, “God revealed Himself to
    humans there.”

The Altar 13-09
=================


Anyone who **disobeyed** **God's law** could bring an animal **to the
altar in front of the Tent of Meeting** as a **sacrifice** to **God**. A
**priest** would kill the animal and burn it on the **altar**. **The
blood of the animal that was sacrificed covered the person’s sin**
and made that person **clean in God's sight**. God chose **Moses'**
brother, **Aaron**, and Aaron's **descendants** to be his priests.

Translation Notes:
------------------

-   **God's law** - This refers to all the commandments and instructions
    that God had told the Israelites to obey.
-   **to the Tent of Meeting** - They did not bring the animal inside
    the Tent of Meeting, but to the altar in front of the Tent of
    Meeting. Be sure not to use an expression that means that they
    brought it inside.
-   **covered the person’s sin** - When people brought animals to
    sacrifice, God chose to see the blood of the animals as a covering
    over their sin. This is like hiding something that is ugly or dirty
    by covering it.
-   **clean in God's sight** - This could be translated as, “as if he
    did not have the sin according to God” or, “free of the punishment
    for breaking God's law.”

The People Sinned 13-10
=========================


The people all agreed to **obey** the laws that **God** had **given
them**, to **worship** only God, and to be **his special people**. But a
short time after they **promised** to obey God, they **sinned terribly**.

Translation Notes:
------------------

-   **given them** - This could be translated as, “told them to obey.”
-   **his special people** - From among all the nations, God had chosen
    the Israelites for his special purpose. This could be translated as
    “his special nation” or, “his own people” or, “the nation
    he chose to be his people.”
-   **a short time** – The people sinned during the forty days that
    Moses was on the mountain with God.
-   **sinned terribly** - They sinned in a way that was especially
    offensive to God. This could be translated as, “they sinned
    badly,” or “they did something that was very bad” or, “they
    did something bad that made God very angry.”

Make Us an Idol for Us 13-11
==============================


For many days, **Moses** was on top of **Mount Sinai** talking with
**God**. **The people became tired of waiting** for him to return. So they
**brought gold** to **Aaron** and asked him to make an **idol** for them!

Translation Notes:
------------------

-   **The people became tired of waiting** - This could be translated
    as, “The people became impatient because he did not return
    quickly” or, “The people didn't want to wait any longer for him
    to return.”
-   **brought gold** - These were objects and jewelry made of gold,
    which could be melted and formed into other things.

The Golden Calf 13-12
=======================


**Aaron made a golden idol** in the shape of a calf.  The people began
to **wildly worship** the idol and make **sacrifices** to it! **God**
was very angry with them because of their **sin** and planned to destroy
them. But **Moses** **prayed** for them, and God **listened to his
prayer** and did not destroy them.

Translation Notes:
------------------

-   **made a golden idol** - Aaron took the things made of gold that the
    people had brought to him, melted them, combined them, and formed
    them into the shape of a calf.
-   **wildly worship** - The people were sinning by worshiping the idol
    and also by doing sinful things as they worshiped it.
-   **listened to his prayer** - God always hears prayer. In this
    situation, “listened” means that God agreed to do what Moses
    asked.

Moses Was Angry 13-13
=======================


When **Moses** came down the mountain and saw the **idol**, he was so
angry that he **smashed the stones** on which **God** had written the
**Ten Commandments**.

Translation Notes:
------------------

-   **smashed the stones** - He threw the stones down on the ground and
    they broke up into little pieces.

Moses Destroyed the Idol 13-14
================================


Then **Moses beat the idol into powder**, threw the powder into some
water and made the people drink the water.  **God** sent **a plague**
on the people and many of them died.

Translation Notes:
------------------

-   **beat the idol into powder** - Moses utterly destroyed the idol by
    pounding it into fine particles.
-   **into some water** - Moses scattered the gold powder over a large
    expanse of water.
-   **a plague** - This could be translated as, “a terrible disease.”

Moses Prayed for Israel 13-15
===============================


**Moses** climbed the mountain again and **prayed** that **God**
would **forgive** the people.  God **listened to** Moses and forgave
them. **Moses wrote** the **Ten Commandments** on new stone tablets to
replace the ones he had broken. Then God led the **Israelites** away
from **Mount Sinai** toward the **Promised Land**.

*A Bible story from: Exodus 19-34*

Translation Notes:
------------------

-   **listened to** - See how you translated this phrase in -   **Moses
wrote** - Moses chiseled the words into the stone using a
    tool.
-   *A Bible story from* - These references may be slightly different in
    some Bible translations.

God Led Israel 14-01
======================


After **God** had told the **Israelites** the laws he wanted them to obey
as part of his **covenant** with them, they left **Mount Sinai**. God
began leading them from toward the **Promised Land**, which was also
called **Canaan**. The **pillar of cloud** went ahead of them towards
Canaan and they followed it.

Translation Notes:
------------------

-   **pillar of cloud** - See how you translated this phrase in

The Canaanites' Idols 14-02
=============================


**God** had **promised** **Abraham**, **Isaac**, and **Jacob** that
he would give the **Promised Land** to their **descendants**, but
now there were many **people groups** living there. They were called
**Canaanites**. The Canaanites did not **worship** or **obey** God. They
worshiped **false gods** and did many **evil** things.

Translation Notes:
------------------

**

Destroy the Canaanites 14-03
==============================


**God** told the **Israelites**, “You must **get rid of** all the
**Canaanites** in the **Promised Land**. **Do not make peace with them**
and **do not marry them**. You must completely destroy all of their
**idols**. If you do not **obey** me, **you will worship their idols**
instead of me.”

Translation Notes:
------------------

-   **get rid of** - This could be translated as, “get them out of the
    land” or, “remove them from the land.”
-   **Do not make peace with them** - This could be translated as, “Do
    not live peacefully among or alongside them” or, “Do not promise
    to live peacefully with them.”
-   **do not marry them** - God did not want any Israelite person to
    marry any Canaanite person.
-   **you will worship their idols** - If the Israelites became friends
    with the Canaanites and did not destroy the idols, they would
    be tempted to worship those idols instead of God. You could say,
    “you will end up worshiping” to make it clear that this would
    result from living so close to the Canaanites and learning their ways.

The Twelve Spies 14-04
========================


When the **Israelites** reached the border of **Canaan**, **Moses**
chose twelve men, one from each tribe of **Israel**. He gave the men
instructions to go and **spy on the land** to see what it was like.
They were also to **spy on the Canaanites to see if they were strong
or weak**.

Translation Notes:
------------------

-   **spy on the land** - This could be translated as, “secretly get
    information about the land” or, “secretly learn about the land.”
    Part of the spies' task was to find out what kinds of food the land
    could produce.
-   **spy on the Canaanites** - This could be translated as, “secretly
    get information about the people of Canaan” or, “secretly learn
    about the Canaanites.”
-   **to see if they were strong or weak** - They wanted to know if the
    Canaanites were prepared to fight against them. This could be
    translated as, “to find out how powerful the Canaanite armies
    were.”

The Bad Report 14-05
======================


The twelve men traveled through **Canaan** for forty days and then **they
came back**. They told the people, “The land is very fertile and the
crops are plentiful!” But ten of the spies said, “**The cities are
very strong** and **the people are giants**! If we attack them, they
will certainly defeat us and kill us!”

Translation Notes:
------------------

-   **they came back** - They returned to where the rest of the
    Israelites were waiting, just outside the border of Canaan.
-   **The cities are very strong** - The cities had strong walls around
    them, so it would be very difficult for the Israelites to attack them.
-   **the people are giants** – This could be translated as, “the
people
    are like giants compared to us!” or, “the people are much taller
    and stronger than we are!”

Joshua and Caleb 14-06
========================


Immediately **Caleb** and **Joshua**, the other two spies, said, “It
is true that the **people of Canaan** are tall and strong, but **we can
certainly defeat them!  God will fight for us**!”

Translation Notes:
------------------

-   **people of Canaan** – This could be translated as, “the
people who
    live in Canaan” or, “the Canaanites.”
-   **we can certainly defeat them! God will fight for us** – To show
    the connection between these two statements, it may be necessary to
    say, “we can certainly defeat them because God will fight for us!”
-   **God will fight for us** – This could be translated as, “God will
    fight alongside us and help us defeat them!” This makes it clear
    that the Israelites would also be fighting against the Canaanites.

The People Rebelled 14-07
===========================


But the people did not listen to **Caleb** and **Joshua**. They became
angry with **Moses** and **Aaron** and said, “**Why did you bring us**
to **this horrible place**? We should have stayed in **Egypt rather
than be killed in battle and our wives and children made slaves**.”
The people wanted to choose a different leader to take them back to Egypt.

Translation Notes:
------------------

-   **Why did you bring us** – This is not a real question. It is a way
    that some languages use to say, “You should not have brought us.”
-   **this horrible place** - They considered Canaan to be “horrible”
    because they thought it was so dangerous that they would all be
    killed.
-   **rather than be killed in battle and our wives and children made
    slaves** - This could be translated as, “If we fight against the
    Canaanites, they will kill us men and force our wives and children
    to be their slaves.”

God Spoke 14-08
=================


**God was very angry** and **came to** the **Tent of Meeting**.  **God**
said, “Because you have rebelled against me, all of the people will have
to **wander in the wilderness**. Except for **Joshua** and **Caleb**,
everyone who is twenty years or older will die there and never enter
the **Promised Land**.”

Translation Notes:
------------------

-   **came to** - God did not appear as a person, but came in some other
    form that showed his glory and power.
-   **wander in the wilderness** - God would lead the people around in
    the wilderness with no specific destination until all of the adults
    who rebelled against him died.

The People Ignored God 14-09
==============================


When the people heard this, they were sorry **they had sinned**. They took
their weapons and went to attack the people of **Canaan**.  **Moses warned
them not to go** because **God was not with them**, **but they did not
listen to him**.

Translation Notes:
------------------

-   **they had sinned** - It may be necessary to add, “they had sinned
    by disobeying God's command to conquer the peoples of Canaan.”
-   **Moses warned them not to go** - This means that Moses told them
    not to go to fight against the Canaanites because they would be in
    danger if they did that.
-   **God was not with them** – In other words, God would not be with
    them to help them. Because of the Israelites' disobedience, God
    withdrew from them his presence, protection, and power.
-   **but they did not listen to him** - They did not obey Moses. They
    went to attack the Canaanites anyway.

The Canaanites Defeated Israel 14-10
======================================


**God did not go with them into this battle**, so they were defeated and
many of them were killed. Then the **Israelites turned back from Canaan**
and **wandered through the wilderness** for forty years.

Translation Notes:
------------------

-   **God did not go with them into this battle** - In other words, God
    did not help them in this fight.
-   **turned back from Canaan** - They left Canaan and went back into
    the wilderness where they were before.
-   **wandered through the wilderness** - They lived in the wilderness,
    and together they moved from place to place in that large, dry land,
    looking for food and water for themselves and their animals.

Manna from Heaven 14-11
=========================


During the forty years that the people of **Israel** wandered in the
wilderness, **God provided for them**. He gave them **bread from heaven,
called “manna.” He also sent flocks of quail**  **into their camp**
so they could have meat to eat. During all that time, God kept their
clothes and shoes from wearing out.

Translation Notes:
------------------

-   **God provided for them** – This could be translated as, “God gave
    them everything they needed for food, water, and shelter.”
-   **bread from heaven, called “manna”** - This thin, bread-like food
    fell from the sky overnight onto the grass like dew. They called it
    “manna.” Almost every day the people gathered this “manna”
    and cooked it as their food.
-   **He also sent flocks of quail…camp** - Another way to say this
    would be, “He also caused a large number of quails to fly into
    their camp.” If quails are unknown, a different, similar type bird
    could be used. Or it could be translated as, “a large number of
    medium-sized birds.”
-   **their camp** - The place where the Israelites set up their tents
    to sleep in was called a “camp.” It was like a city with tents
    instead of buildings, and it could be moved around.

Water from a Rock 14-12
=========================


**God** even **miraculously gave them water from a rock**. **But despite
all this**, the people of **Israel** complained and grumbled against God
and against **Moses**. **Even so, God was still faithful to his promises**
to **Abraham**, **Isaac**, and **Jacob**.

Translation Notes:
------------------

-   **miraculously gave them water from a rock** - This could be
    translated, “by doing something that only God can do, he made
    water pour out of a rock so the people and animals could drink.”
-   **But despite all this** - This could be translated as, “But even
    though God provided food, water, clothing, and everything that
    they needed.”
-   **Even so** - This could be translated, “Even though the Israelites
    complained and grumbled against him.”
-   **God was still faithful to his promises** - This could be
    translated, “God continued to do what he had told Abraham, Isaac,
    and Jacob he would do.” He provided their descendants with what
    they needed so they that could live and become a great nation and
    eventually own the land of Canaan.

Moses Struck the Rock 14-13
=============================


Another time when the people did not have any water, **God** told
**Moses**, “Speak to the rock, and water will come out of it.” But
**Moses dishonored God** in front of all the people **by hitting the
rock twice with a stick instead of speaking to it**. Water came out of
the rock for everyone to drink, but God was angry with Moses and said,
“You will not enter the **Promised Land**.”

Translation Notes:
------------------

-   **Moses dishonored God** - This could be translated, “Moses
    disobeyed God” or, “Moses disrespected God.” God had a specific
    way He wanted Moses to show the people God's power to provide for
    them.  When Moses disobeyed God by doing it in a different way he
    showed a lack of respect for God.
-   **by hitting the rock twice with a stick instead of speaking to it**
    - This can be translated as, “Moses did not speak to the rock;
    he hit it twice with a stick.”

At the Promised Land 14-14
============================


After the **Israelites** had wandered in the wilderness for forty years,
all of them **who had rebelled against God** were dead. Then God led
**the people** to the edge of the **Promised Land** again.  **Moses**
was now very old, so God chose **Joshua** to help him lead the people. God
also **promised** Moses that **one day**, he would send **another prophet
like Moses**.

Translation Notes:
------------------

-   **who had rebelled against God** - This could be translated, “who
    had refused to obey God when he told them to go into the Promised
    Land.”
-   **the people** - That is, the children of the generation that died.
-   **one day** - This means, “some time in the future.” -   **another
prophet like Moses** - Like Moses, this man would be an
    Israelite, he would speak God's words to the people, and he would
    lead the people.

The Death of Moses 14-15
==========================


Then **God** told **Moses** to go to the top of a mountain so he could
see the **Promised Land**. Moses saw the Promised Land but God did not
permit him to enter it. Then Moses died, and the **Israelites mourned
for thirty days**.  **Joshua** became their new leader. Joshua was a
good leader because he **trusted** and **obeyed** God.

*A Bible story from: Exodus 16-17; Numbers 10-14; 20; 27; Deuteronomy 34*

Translation Notes:
------------------

-   **mourned for thirty days** - For thirty days all the people of
    Israel cried and showed that they were very sad that Moses had died.
-   *A Bible story from* - These references may be slightly different in
    some Bible translations.

The Two Spies 15-01
=====================


**At last it was time for** the **Israelites** to **enter Canaan**, the
**Promised Land**.  **Joshua** sent **two spies to the Canaanite city
of Jericho** that was **protected by strong walls**. In that city there
lived a prostitute named **Rahab** who hid the spies and later helped
them to **escape**. She did this because she **believed** **God**. They
**promised** to protect Rahab and **her family** when the Israelites
would destroy Jericho.

Translation Notes:
------------------

-   **At last it was time for** - “At last” means “finally” or,
“after a
    long wait.” To make it clear what “time” refers to, you
    could say, “after they had wandered in the desert for 40 years,
    God finally permitted.”
-   **two spies to the Canaanite city of Jericho** - This could be
    translated as, “two men to Jericho, a city in Canaan, to find
    out information about it.” Also see the notes for, “spy out the
    land” in
-   **protected by strong walls** - This could be translated as,
    “completely surrounded by thick, strong walls made of stone to
    protect it from their enemies.”
-   **escape** – It is also possible to add, “escape from people in
    Jericho who wanted to harm them.”
-   **her family** - Rahab asked for protection for her father, mother,
    brothers, and sisters. Use your word for family that includes
    these people.

Crossing the Jordan River 15-02
=================================


The **Israelites** had to cross the **Jordan River** to enter into the
**Promised Land**.  **God** told **Joshua**, “**Have the priests go
first**.” When the priests started to step into the Jordan River,
**the water upstream stopped flowing** so the Israelites could cross
over to the other side of the river on dry ground.

Translation Notes:
------------------

-   **Have the priests go first** – For some languages it may be helpful
    to add, “Have the priests go before the rest of the people to
    cross the river.”
-   **the water upstream stopped flowing** — In some languages it may be
    helpful to add, “and the water in front of them flowed away
    downstream.”

Marching around Jericho 15-03
===============================


**After the people crossed the Jordan River**, **God** told **Joshua
how to attack** the powerful city of **Jericho**. The people **obeyed**
God. Just as God told them to do, the soldiers and **priests** marched
around the city of Jericho **once a day for six days**.

Translation Notes:
------------------

-   **After the people crossed the Jordan River** – In some languages it
    is better to say, “The people crossed the Jordan River and
    then…”
-   **how to attack** – This could be translated as, “exactly what he
    should do to attack.”
-   **once a day for six days** - That is, they went around the city one
    time every day for a total of six days.

Shouting to God 15-04
=======================


Then on the seventh day, the **Israelites**marched around the city seven
more times. **While they marched around the city for the last time**,
the soldiers shouted while the **priests blew their trumpets**.

Translation Notes:
------------------

-   **While they marched around the city for the last time** - This can
    be translated as, “During their final circuit around the city.”
-   **blew their trumpets** - This could be translated as, “They sounded
    their trumpets” or, “They played their trumpets.” These trumpets
    were made out of ram's horns.

The Walls Fell Down 15-05
===========================


Then the walls around **Jericho** fell down!  The **Israelites** destroyed
everything in the city as **God** had commanded. They only spared
**Rahab** and her family, who **became part of** the Israelites. When the
other people living in **Canaan** heard that the Israelites had destroyed
Jericho, they were terrified that the Israelites would attack them also.

Translation Notes:
------------------

-   **became part of** - This can be translated as, “who then joined the
    Israelite community” or, “who then became members of the nation
    of Israel.”

The Gibeonites' Lie 15-06
===========================


**God** had commanded the **Israelites** not to make a **peace treaty**
with any of the people groups in **Canaan**. **But one of the Canaanite
people groups, called the Gibeonites**, **lied to Joshua and said** they
were from a place far from Canaan. They asked Joshua to make a peace
treaty with them. Joshua and the Israelites did not ask God **where the
Gibeonites were from**. So Joshua made a peace treaty with them.

Translation Notes:
------------------

-   **peace treaty** – This is an agreement between two groups of people
    that they will not harm each other but will live in peace and help
    each other. This could be translated as, “peace agreement.”
-   **But one of the Canaanite people groups called the Gibeonites** –
    Some languages may introduce this as, “But one day a Canaanite
    people group by the name of the Gibeonites …”
-   **lied to Joshua and said** - This could be translated as, “They
    lied to Joshua by saying” or, “They falsely said to Joshua” or,
    “They falsely told Joshua.”
-   **where the Gibeonites were from** - That is, “where the Gibeonites
    lived” or, “where the Gibeonites' home was.” “Gibeonites”
    means, “people of Gibeon.”

The Gibeonites in Danger 15-07
================================


The **Israelites** were angry when they found out that the **Gibeonites**
had deceived them, but they kept the **peace** treaty they had made with
them because it was a **promise** before **God**. Some time later, the
**kings** of another people group in **Canaan**, the **Amorites**, heard
that the Gibeonites had made a peace treaty with the Israelites, so they
combined their armies into one large army and attacked **Gibeon**. The
Gibeonites **sent a message to Joshua asking for help**.

Translation Notes:
------------------

-   **sent a message to Joshua asking for help** - This could be
    translated as, “sent some of their people to tell Joshua that they
    needed the Israelites to help defend them against their enemies.”

Israel Helped the Gibeonites 15-08
====================================


So **Joshua** gathered the **Israelite** army and they marched all night
**to reach the Gibeonites**. In the early morning **they surprised the
Amorite armies** and attacked them.

Translation Notes:
------------------

-   **to reach the Gibeonites** - That is, “to get to the Gibeonites”
    or, “to arrive at where the Gibeonites lived.” The Gibeonites
    lived in Canaan, but Canaan is big enough that it took all night
    for the Israelite army to travel from their camp to where the
    Gibeonites were.
-   **they surprised the Amorite armies** - The Amorites did not know
    that the Israelites were coming to attack them.

God Fought the Amorites 15-09
===============================


**God fought for Israel** that day. He **caused the Amorites to be
confused** and he sent **large hailstones** that killed many of the
Amorites.

Translation Notes:
------------------

-   **God fought for Israel** - God fought on the side of Israel against
    Israel's enemies.
-   **caused the Amorites to be confused** - This could be translated
    as, “made the Amorites panic” or, “caused the Amorites to be
    unable to fight together well.”
-   **large hailstones** - This could be translated as, “very large
    balls of ice to come down from the sky.”

The Sun Stood Still 15-10
===========================


**God** also caused the sun to stay in one place in the sky so
that **Israel** would have enough time to completely defeat the
**Amorites**. On that day, God won a great victory for Israel.

Translation Notes:
------------------

-   **

Israel Defeated the Canaanites 15-11
======================================


After God defeated those armies, many of the other **Canaanite** people
groups gathered together to attack **Israel**.  **Joshua** and the
Israelites **attacked and destroyed them**.

Translation Notes:
------------------

-   **attacked and destroyed them** - This could be translated as,
    “fought against them and defeated them.”

Dividing the Promised Land 15-12
==================================


After this battle, **God gave each tribe of Israel its own section of
the Promised Land**. Then God **gave Israel peace along all its borders**.

Translation Notes:
------------------

-   **God gave…Land** – this could be translated as, “God appointed
each
    tribe its own plot of land” or, “God decided which part of the
    Promised Land each tribe of Israel would live on.”
-   **gave Israel peace along all its borders** – This could be
    translated as, “God allowed the Israelites to experience peace
    with the other people groups that surrounded them” or, “the
    other countries around Israel.”

Joshua Renewed the Covenant 15-13
===================================


**When Joshua was an old man**, he called all the people of **Israel**
together. Then Joshua reminded the people of their obligation to
**obey** the **covenant** that **God** had made with the **Israelites**
at **Sinai**. The people **promised** to **remain faithful to God**
and **follow his laws**.

*A Bible story from: Joshua 1-24*

Translation Notes:
------------------

-   **When Joshua was an old man** – It may be clearer to say, “Many
    years later, when Joshua was an old man.” Joshua was over 100
    years old at this time.
-   **remain faithful to God** - In other words, they would be loyal to
    God. They would worship and serve only God; they would not worship
    or serve any other gods.
-   **follow his laws** - This means that the people would obey the laws
    that God had given them already as part of the covenant.
-   *A Bible story from* - These references may be slightly different in
    some Bible translations.

Israel Worshiped Idols 16-01
==============================


After **Joshua** died, the **Israelites** **disobeyed** **God and did not
drive out the rest of the Canaanites or obey God's laws**. The Israelites
began to **worship** the Canaanite **gods** instead of **Yahweh**, **the
true God**. The Israelites had no **king**, so everyone did **what they
thought was right for them**.

Translation Notes:
------------------

-   **and did not drive out** – This tells how they disobeyed God, so in
    some languages it may be better to start this as a new sentence,
    “They did not.”
-   **drive out the rest of the Canaanites** - This can be translated,
    “fight with the rest of the Canaanites to force them to leave
    the land.”
-   **or obey God's laws** - This means that the people also disobeyed
    the laws that God gave to the Israelites at Mount Sinai.
-   **the true God** - That is, “the only real God.” Yahweh is
the only
    one that people should worship.
-   **what they thought was right for them** – This means that they all
    did whatever they wanted to do, including many evil things.

Enemies Defeated Israel 16-02
===============================


Because the **Israelites** kept **disobeying** **God**, he **punished**
them by allowing their enemies to defeat them. These enemies stole
things from the Israelites, destroyed their property, and killed many
of them. After many years of disobeying God and being oppressed by their
enemies, the Israelites **repented** and **asked God to rescue them**.

Translation Notes:
------------------

-   **asked God to rescue them** - That is, they asked God to help them
    and to set them free from their enemies.

The Deliverer 16-03
=====================


Then **God provided** a **deliverer** who rescued them from their
enemies and **brought peace** to **the land**. But then **the people
forgot about God** and started **worshiping** **idols** again. So God
allowed the **Midianites**, a nearby enemy people group, to defeat them.

Translation Notes:
------------------

-   **God provided** - This could be translated as, “God chose”
or, “God
    appointed” or, “God raised up.”
-   **brought peace** - This could be translated as, “allowed the people
    to live without fear” or, “ended the fighting” or, “stopped
    their enemies from attacking them.”
-   **the land** - That refers to Canaan, the Promised Land that God had
    given to Abraham.
-   **the people forgot about God** - This means, “The people stopped
    thinking about God and ignored what he had commanded them.”

The Rule of Midian 16-04
==========================


The **Midianites** took all of the **Israelites' crops** for seven
years. The Israelites were **so scared; they hid** in caves so the
Midianites would not find them. Finally, they **cried out** to **God**
to **save them**.

Translation Notes:
------------------

-   **crops** - This refers to plants that the Israelites were growing
    in their gardens or fields for food.
-   **were so scared; they hid** – This could be translated as, “were
    very afraid of the Midianites, so they hid.”
-   **cried out** - This might be translated as, “they called out” or,
    “they prayed desperately.”
-   **save them** – This might be translated as, “set them free” or,
    “rescue them from these enemies.”

An Angel Spoke to Gideon 16-05
================================


**One day**, a man of Israel named **Gideon** was **threshing grain
secretly** so the **Midianites** would not steal it. The **angel**
of **Yahweh** came to Gideon and said, “**God is with you**, mighty
warrior. Go and save **Israel** from the Midianites.”

Translation Notes:
------------------

-   **One day** - This phrase introduces an event that happened in the
    past, but does not state the specific time. Many languages have a
    similar way to begin telling a true story.
-   **threshing grain** - The grain was wheat, which has a head of many
    small grains, or seeds, on the top of a thin stalk. “Threshing”
    is separating the seeds of the plant from the stalks by beating the
    heads of grain. The seeds are food, but the stalks are not.
-   **secretly** - Gideon was threshing the grain in a hidden location,
    so the Midianites would not see him.
-   **God is with you** – This means, “God is present with you in a
    special way” or, “God has plans to use you in a special way.”

Gideon Destroyed the Idol 16-06
=================================


**Gideon's** father had an **altar** dedicated to an **idol**.  **God**
told Gideon **to tear down** that altar. But Gideon was **afraid of the
people**, so he **waited until nighttime**. Then he tore down the altar
and smashed it to pieces. He built a new altar to God near where the
altar to the idol used to be and made a **sacrifice** to God on it.

Translation Notes:
------------------

-   **to tear down** - This means, “to violently bring down” or, “to
    take down and destroy.”
-   **afraid of the people** - Gideon was afraid that his fellow
    Israelites who worshiped the same idol would be angry with him.
-   **waited until nighttime** - Another way to say this would be,
    “waited until after dark.” Gideon smashed the altar at night
    when everyone was asleep so that no one would see him do it.

Gideon Was Rescued 16-07
==========================


The next morning the people saw that someone had torn down and destroyed
the **altar**, and they were very angry. They went to **Gideon's** house
to kill him, but Gideon's father said, “**Why are you trying to help
your god**? **If he is a god, let him protect himself**!” Because he
said this, the people did not kill Gideon.

Translation Notes:
------------------

-   **Why are you trying to help your god?** - This is not a real
    question that asks for information. Another way of saying this would
    be, “You should not be trying to help your god” or, “You should
    not need to help your god.”
-   **If he is a god, let him protect himself** - This means, “If he
    were truly a god, he would be able to defend himself.”

Midian Attacked Israel Again 16-08
====================================


Then the **Midianites came again to steal from the Israelites**. There
were so many of them that **they could not be counted**.  **Gideon**
called the Israelites together to fight them. Gideon asked **God** **for
two signs** so he could be sure **that God would use him to save Israel**.

Translation Notes:
------------------

-   **came again to steal from the Israelites** – This could be
    translated as, “came again to the Israelites' land to steal things
    from them.”
-   **they could not be counted** - This could be translated as, “The
    number of the Midianites was too great to count” or, “it would
    be very difficult to count all of the Midianites.”
-   **for two signs** - This could be translated as, “to do two
    miracles” or, “to make two impossible things happen.”
-   **that God would use him** – This could be translated as,
“that God
    would enable him” or, “that God would help him” or, “that
    God was calling him.”
-   **to save Israel** - This could be translated as, “to rescue Israel
    from the Midianites.”

The Wet Cloth 16-09
=====================


For the first **sign**, **Gideon** laid a cloth on the ground and asked
**God** to **let the morning dew fall** only on the cloth and not on the
ground.  **God did that**. The next night, he asked that the ground be
wet but the cloth dry. God did that too. These two signs convinced Gideon
that God would use him to **save** **Israel** from the **Midianites**.

Translation Notes:
------------------

-   **sign** - This could be translated as, “miracle” or,
“impossible
    thing.”
-   **let the morning dew fall** - This can be translated as, “make the
    morning dew appear” or, “make the morning dew come up.”
    “Dew” refers to the drops of water that appear on the ground in
    the morning. Dew naturally covers everything equally.
-   **God did that** - This could be translated as, “God did what Gideon
    asked him to do.”

Too Many Soldiers 16-10
=========================


**32,000 Israelite soldiers came to Gideon**, but **God** told him
this was **too many**. So Gideon sent home 22,000 who were afraid to
fight. God told Gideon that he still had too many men. So Gideon sent
all of them home **except for 300 soldiers**.

Translation Notes:
------------------

-   **32,000 Israelite soldiers came to Gideon** - Some languages might
    need to insert the following sentence at the beginning of the
    story: “Gideon called the Israelites to come fight against the
    Midianites.” See
-   **too many** - This was more soldiers than God wanted for this
    fight. If that many solders fought and won, they would think that
    they won the battle with their own strength, and they would not know
    that God did it.
-   **except for 300 soldiers** - This sentence could be translated as,
    “So Gideon allowed only 300 men to stay, and the rest of the men
    went home.”

The Midianite's Dream 16-11
=============================


That night **God** told **Gideon**, “**Go down** to the **Midianite**
camp and when you hear what they say, you will **no longer be afraid**.”
So that night, Gideon went down to the camp and heard a Midianite soldier
telling his friend about **something he had dreamed**. The man’s friend
said, “This dream means that Gideon's army will defeat the Midianite
army!” When Gideon heard this, he **worshiped** God.

Translation Notes:
------------------

-   **Go down** - The Midianite soldiers were camping out in a valley
    and were at a lower elevation than the Israelite soldiers.
-   **you will no longer be afraid** – That is, “you will stop being
    afraid.”
-   **something he had dreamed** – That is, “something he had seen
in a
    dream” or, “a dream he had had.”

Gideon's Army 16-12
=====================


Then **Gideon** returned to his soldiers and gave each of them a
**horn**, a clay pot, and **a torch**. They surrounded the camp where
the **Midianite** soldiers were sleeping. Gideon's 300 men soldiers had
the torches in the pots so the Midianites could not see the light of
the torches.

Translation Notes:
------------------

-   **horn** - This could be translated as, “trumpet” or, “ram's
horn
    trumpet.” These horns came from a male sheep and were often used
    to call men for battle.
-   **a torch** - This was probably a piece of wood wrapped with cloth
    and soaked in oil so that it could burn well. (This was not the
    modern torch that runs on batteries.)

The Attack 16-13
==================


Then, all of **Gideon's** soldiers broke their pots at the same moment,
suddenly revealing the fire of the torches. They blew their horns and
**shouted**, “**A sword for God and for Gideon**!”

Translation Notes:
------------------

-   **shouted** - This could be translated as, “yelled loudly” or,
“said
    with a very loud voice.”
-   **sword** - A sword is a weapon that has a long sharp blade and a
    handle at one end. People hold the handle and hit or stab the enemy
    with the sharp blade. If your people don't have a weapon just like
    this, you could translate it as a “long knife,” “machete” or,
    “bush knife.”
-   **A sword for God and for Gideon** - This means, “We fight for God
    and for Gideon!”

God Defeated the Midianites 16-14
===================================


**God confused the Midianites**, so that they started attacking and
killing each other. Immediately, **the rest of the Israelites were
called** from their homes to come help chase the Midianites. They
killed many of them and chased the rest of them out of the Israelites'
land. 120,000 Midianites died that day. God had **saved** **Israel**.

Translation Notes:
------------------

-   **God confused the Midianites** - God caused the Midianites to be
    confused. They wanted to attack the Israelites, but instead, they
    attacked each other.
-   **the rest of the Israelites** - This could be translated as, “many
    other Israelite men.” This refers to the soldiers previously sent
    home in
-   **were called** – That is, “were called out” or, “were
summoned.”
    This sentence could also be translated as, “Gideon sent messengers
    to summon many other Israelite men from their homes.”

An Offering for Gideon 16-15
==============================


The people wanted to make **Gideon** their **king**. Gideon **did not
allow them to do this**, **but he asked them** for some of the gold
rings that each of them had taken from the **Midianites**. The people
gave Gideon a large amount of gold.

Translation Notes:
------------------

-   **did not allow them to do this** - Gideon knew that it was better
    for the Israelites to have God as their king.
-   **but he asked them** – This phrase starts with “but” because
what
    he did next was not wise.

Gideon Made an Idol 16-16
===========================


Then **Gideon used the gold to make a special garment** like the **high
priest** used to wear. But the people started **worshiping** it as if
it were an **idol**. So **God** **punished** **Israel** again because
they worshiped idols. God allowed their enemies to defeat them. They
finally asked God for help again, and God sent them another **deliverer**.

Translation Notes:
------------------

-   **Gideon used the gold to make a special garment** – This could be
    translated as, “Gideon melted down the gold objects the people
    had given him and formed a special garment out of that gold.”
-   **turned away from God** - This could be translated as, “disobeyed
    God” or, “stopped worshiping God.”

Sin and Deliverance 16-17
===========================


**This pattern repeated many times**: the **Israelites** would **sin**,
**God** would **punish** them, they would **repent**, and God would
send a **deliverer** to **save** them. Over many years, God sent many
deliverers who saved the Israelites from their enemies.

Translation Notes:
------------------

-   **This pattern repeated many times** - This could be translated as,
    “These things kept happening again and again” or, “These things
    happened many times.”

Israel Wanted a King 16-18
============================


**Finally**, the people **asked God for a king like all the other nations
had**. They wanted a king who was tall and strong, and who could lead
them into battle. **God did not like this request**, but he gave them
a king just as they had asked.

*A Bible story from: Judges 1-3; 6-8*

Translation Notes:
------------------

-   **Finally** - This could be translated as, “After their enemies
    attacked them many times” or, “After many years of being attacked
    by many different nations.”
-   **asked God for a king** - This could be translated as, “demanded
    that God give them a king” or, “kept asking God for a king.”
-   **like all the other nations had** - Other nations had a king.
    Israel wanted to be like them and have a king too.
-   **God did not like this request** – This could be translated as,
    “God did not agree with what they had asked him for.” God knew
    that they were rejecting him as their ruler and were instead choosing
    to follow a human leader.
-   *A Bible story from* - These references may be slightly different in
    some Bible translations.

Wicked King Saul 17-01
========================


**Saul** was the **first king of Israel**. He was tall and handsome,
just like the people wanted. Saul was a good king for the first few years
that he ruled over Israel. But then he became a wicked man who did not
**obey** **God**, so God chose a different man who would **one day be
king in his place**.

Translation Notes:
------------------

-   **first king of Israel** – This could be translated as, “first
king
    to rule over Israel.”
-   **one day** – This could be translated as, “some time in the
future”
    or “years later.”
-   **be king in his place** – Another way to say this would be, “take
    his place as king over Israel” or, “rule as king instead of
    him.”

David the Shepherd 17-02
==========================


**God** chose a young **Israelite** named **David** to be **king** after
**Saul**. David was a **shepherd** from the town of **Bethlehem**. At
different times while he was **watching** his father's **sheep**, David
had killed both a lion and a bear that had attacked the sheep. David
was a **humble** and **righteous** man who **trusted** and **obeyed** God.

Translation Notes:
------------------

-   **watching** - That is, “caring for” or, “protecting” or,
“taking
    care of.”

David Killed Goliath 17-03
============================


**David** became a great soldier and leader. When David was still a
young man, he fought against **a giant named Goliath**. Goliath was a
trained soldier, very strong, and almost three meters tall! But **God**
helped David kill Goliath and save **Israel**. After that, David won many
victories over Israel's enemies, for which the people **praised** him.

Translation Notes:
------------------

-   **a giant named Goliath** - The word “giant” here describes
a person
    who is unusually large and powerful. Goliath was a huge soldier in
    an army that was fighting against Israel.

Saul Chased David 17-04
=========================


**Saul** became jealous of the people's **love** for **David**. Saul
tried many times to kill him, so David hid from Saul. **One day**, Saul
was looking for David so he could kill him. Saul went into the same cave
where David was hiding from Saul, but Saul did not see him. David was now
very close to Saul and could have killed him, but he did not. Instead,
David cut off a piece of Saul's clothes **to prove to Saul** that he
would not kill him in order to become **king**.

Translation Notes:
------------------

-   **One day** - This phrase introduces an event that happened in the
    past, but does not state the specific time. Many languages have a
    similar way to begin telling a true story.
-   **to prove to Saul** - That is, “to convince Saul” or, “to show
    Saul.”
-   **to become king** – David would not dishonor God by killing the man
    that God placed as king over Israel.

David Became King 17-05
=========================


Eventually, **Saul** died in battle, and **David** became **king** of
**Israel**. He was a good king, and the people **loved** him. **God**
**blessed** David and **made him successful**. David fought many battles
and God helped him defeat Israel's enemies. David conquered **Jerusalem**
and made it **his capital city**. **During David’s reign**, Israel
became powerful and wealthy.

Translation Notes:
------------------

-   **made him successful** - That is, “helped him accomplish the good
    things he wanted to do.”
-   **his capital city** - That is, “the capital city of his kingdom.”
    David lived in Jerusalem and ruled from there.
-   **During David’s reign** - That is, “During the time when
David was
    king over Israel” or, “During the time when David was ruling as
    king over Israel.”

David Wanted to Build a Temple 17-06
======================================


**David** wanted to **build a temple** where all the **Israelites**
could **worship** **God** and offer him **sacrifices**. For about 400
years, the people had been worshiping God and offering sacrifices to
him at the **Tent of Meeting** that **Moses** had built.

Translation Notes:
------------------

-   **build a temple** - David wanted to construct a permanent building
    for worshiping God that would replace the portable Tent of Meeting.

God's Promise to David 17-07
==============================


But **God** sent **the prophet Nathan** to **David** with this message,
“Because you are a **man of war**, you will not build **this Temple**
for me. Your **son** will build it. But, I will **bless** you greatly.
Someone from your family will always rule as **king** of **Israel**,
and the **Messiah** will be one of your **descendants**!” The Messiah
was God’s Chosen One who would save people of the world from **sin**.

Translation Notes:
------------------

-   **the prophet Nathan** – It may be more natural in some languages to
    say, “a prophet named Nathan.”
-   **man of war** - That is, “man who fights battles.” David killed
    many, many people in battle against the Israelites' enemies. God
    wasn't punishing David, but God wanted a man of peace to build the
    Temple where people would worship him.
-   **this Temple** - That is, “this building for worship” or, “this
    place of worship.”
-   **from sin** - That is, “from the terrible consequences of their
    sin.”

David Praised God 17-08
=========================


When **David** heard **these words**, he immediately thanked and
**praised** **God** because he had **promised** David **this great
honor** and many **blessings**. David did not know when God would do
these things. But as it happened, the **Israelites** would have to wait
a long time before the **Messiah** came, almost 1,000 years.

Translation Notes:
------------------

-   **these words** - That is, “the words the prophet had just said.”
    This refers back to the promises in
-   **this great honor** - People who lived later would highly respect
    David because some of his descendants would be kings over Israel
    and one of them would be the Messiah.

God Blessed David 17-09
=========================


**David ruled with justice and faithfulness for many years**, and **God**
**blessed** him. However, **toward the end of his life** he **sinned
terribly** against God.

Translation Notes:
------------------

-   **David ruled with justice and faithfulness for many years** - This
    could be translated as, “When David ruled the people, for many
    years he did what was right and fair, and he was faithful to God.”
-   **toward the end of his life** - This may be translated as, “when
    David was older” or “later on in David's life.”
-   **sinned terribly** - That is, “sinned in a very evil way.”
David's
    sin was especially evil.

David and Bathsheba 17-10
===========================


**One day**, when all of **David's** soldiers were away from home fighting
battles, he looked out from his palace and **saw** a beautiful woman
**bathing**. Her name was **Bathsheba**.

Translation Notes:
------------------

-   **One day** - This phrase introduces an event that happened in the
    past, but does not state the specific time. Many languages have a
    similar way to begin telling a true story.
-   **saw** - Bathsheba may have been bathing at her own house, but
    David's palace was very high and he was able to see over walls that
    were lower.
-   **bathing** - This may be translated as, “taking a bath” or,
    “washing herself.”

David's Sin 17-11
===================


**Instead of looking away**, **David** sent someone to bring her to
him. **He slept with her** and sent her back home. A short time later
**Bathsheba** sent a message to David saying that she was pregnant.

Translation Notes:
------------------

-   **Instead of looking away** - That is, David did not look away from
    the woman as she bathed, as he should have done.
-   **He slept with her** - This is a polite way to say that David had
    sexual relations with Bathsheba.

David Murdered Uriah 17-12
============================


**Bathsheba's** husband, a man named **Uriah**, was one of **David's**
best soldiers.  David called Uriah back from the battle and told him
to **go be with his wife**. But Uriah refused to go home while the rest
of the soldiers were in battle. So David sent Uriah back to the battle
and told the general to place him **where the enemy was strongest**
so that he would be killed.

Translation Notes:
------------------

-   **go be with his wife** - That is, “go home to be intimate with his
    wife.” David wanted people, especially Uriah, to believe that
    Bathsheba was pregnant with Uriah's child.
-   **where the enemy was strongest** - That is, the location in the
    battle where the most fighting was going on.

Nathan Rebuked David 17-13
============================


After **Uriah** was killed, **David** married **Bathsheba**.  Later, she
gave birth to David's son.  **God** was very angry about what David had
done, so he sent the **prophet** **Nathan** to tell David how **evil**
his **sin** was. David **repented** of his sin and God **forgave** him.
For the rest of his life, **David followed and obeyed God**, even in
difficult times.

Translation Notes:
------------------

-   **what David had done** - This refers to David's adultery with
    Bathsheba and his murder of her husband, Uriah.

Solomon Was Born 17-14
========================


But as **punishment** for **David's** **sin**, his baby boy died.  There
was also **fighting in David’s family** for the rest of his life, and
**David’s power was greatly weakened**. Though David had been unfaithful
to **God**, God was still **faithful** to his **promises**. Later,
David and **Bathsheba** had another son, and they named him **Solomon**.

*A Bible story from: 1 Samuel 10; 15-19; 24; 31; 2 Samuel 5; 7; 11-12*

Translation Notes:
------------------

-   **fighting in David’s family** - This “fighting” was very
serious.
    Among other things, one of his sons murdered another son and tried
    to take David's place as king while David was still reigning. If
    possible, use a word that conveys the intensity of this conflict
    within the family.
-   **David’s power was greatly weakened** - This might be translated
    as, “David became less powerful” or, “David lost much of his
    authority.”
-   *A Bible story from* - These references may be slightly different in
    some Bible translations.

God Made Solomon Wise 18-01
=============================


After many years, **David** died, and his son **Solomon** began to rule
over **Israel**.  **God** spoke to Solomon and asked him what he wanted
most. When Solomon **asked for wisdom**, God was pleased and made him
the wisest man in the world. Solomon learned many things and was a very
wise **judge**.  God also made him very wealthy.

Translation Notes:
------------------

-   **asked for wisdom** - This could be translated as, “asked God to
    make him wise.”

Solomon Built the Temple 18-02
================================


In **Jerusalem**, **Solomon** built the **Temple** for which his father
**David** had planned and gathered materials. People now **worshiped**
**God** and offered **sacrifices** to him at the Temple instead of at
the **Tent of Meeting**.  God came and **was present in the Temple**,
and he lived there **with his people**.

Translation Notes:
------------------

-   **was present in the Temple** – That is, “was present in the
Temple
    in a special way.” Even though God was also present everywhere
    else at the same time, he made himself especially available to the
    people at the Temple.
-   **with his people** - This could be translated as, “in the midst of
    his people” or, “among his people.”

Solomon Served Other Gods 18-03
=================================


But **Solomon** loved women from other countries. He **disobeyed** **God**
by marrying many women, almost 1,000 of them! Many of these women came
from foreign countries and **brought their gods with them** and continued
to **worship** them. When Solomon was old, he also worshiped their gods.

Translation Notes:
------------------

-   **brought their gods with them** - They brought their idols and
    their methods of worshiping idols with them to Israel.

The Kingdom Would Divide 18-04
================================


**God** was angry with **Solomon** and, **as a punishment for Solomon’s
unfaithfulness, he promised to divide** the nation of **Israel** into
two **kingdoms** after Solomon’s death.

Translation Notes:
------------------

-   **as a punishment for Solomon's unfaithfulness, he promised to
    divide** – This could be translated as, “to punish Solomon for
    being unfaithful to him, God solemnly said that he would divide.”

Rehoboam Became King 18-05
============================


After **Solomon** died, his son, **Rehoboam**, became **king**. Rehoboam
was a foolish man. All the people of the **nation of Israel** came
together to **confirm him as king**. They complained to Rehoboam that
Solomon had made them do a lot of hard work and pay a lot of taxes.

Translation Notes:
------------------

-   **confirm him as king** - That is, “tell him that they were glad he
    was king and that they would do what he said.”

Rehoboam's Foolish Answer 18-06
=================================


**Rehoboam** **foolishly answered** them, “You thought my father
**Solomon** made you work hard, but I will make you work harder than he
did, and I will **punish** you more harshly than he did.”

Translation Notes:
------------------

-   **foolishly answered** - Rehoboam's answer was harsh, and caused the
    people to turn against him.

Israel Rebelled against Judah 18-07
=====================================


Ten of the **tribes of the nation of Israel rebelled against
Rehoboam**. Only two tribes **remained faithful to him**.  These two
tribes became the **kingdom of Judah**.

Translation Notes:
------------------

-   **tribes of the nation of Israel** - The descendants of each of
    Jacob's twelve sons had become a “tribe” or very large family
    group in the nation of Israel. Everyone in Israel belonged to one
    of the twelve tribes.
-   **rebelled against Rehoboam** – That is, “refused to follow
Rehoboam
    as their king.” It might help to start this sentence with, “So”
    or, “Because of that” or, “Because of what Rehoboam said.”
-   **remained faithful to him** – That is, “stayed loyal to
him” or,
    “continued to support him as king.”

Jeroboam Ruled Israel 18-08
=============================


The other ten tribes of the **nation of Israel** that rebelled against
**Rehoboam appointed a man named Jeroboam to be their king**. They **set
up their kingdom** in the northern part of the land and were called the
**kingdom of Israel**.

Translation Notes:
------------------

-   **set up their kingdom** - This may be translated as, they
    “established” or, “built” their kingdom. This sentence may
    also be translated as, “They separated themselves from the other
    two tribes and lived in the northern part of the land, and they
    called their country 'Israel.'”

Jeroboam Made an Idol 18-09
=============================


**Jeroboam** **rebelled** against **God** and **caused the people to
sin**. He built two **idols** for his people to **worship instead of
worshiping God at the Temple in the kingdom of Judah**.

Translation Notes:
------------------

-   **caused the people to sin** - This could be translated as, “led the
    people to sin” or, “motivated the people to sin.” Rehoboam
    led the people into sin by making idols for them to worship.
-   **instead of worshiping God at…Judah** - This can be translated as,
    “so that they would not worship God at” or, “instead of going
    to the kingdom of Judah to worship God at the Temple.”

Israel and Judah at War 18-10
===============================


The **kingdoms** of **Judah** and **Israel** became enemies and often
fought against each other.

Translation Notes:
------------------

-   **Judah and Israel** - The people of Judah and Israel were all
    descendants of Jacob and part of God's people. Even so, they disobeyed
    God and fought and killed each other.

The Evil Kings of Israel 18-11
================================


In the new **kingdom** of **Israel**, all the **kings** were
**evil**. Many of these kings were killed by other **Israelites** who
wanted to become king in their place.

Translation Notes:
------------------

-   **Israelites** - Here, “Israelites” refers only to the people
living
    in the northern kingdom of Israel, not to the people living in the
    southern kingdom of Judah.

Israel Worshiped Idols 18-12
==============================


All of the **kings** and most of the people of the **kingdom of Israel**
**worshiped** **idols**. Their idol worship often included sexual
immorality and sometimes even **child sacrifice**.

Translation Notes:
------------------

-   **child sacrifice** - They killed children as offerings to some of
    their idols.

Judah Was Unfaithful 18-13
============================


The **kings** of **Judah** were **descendants** of **David**. Some of
these kings were **good** men who **ruled justly** and **worshiped**
**God**. But most of Judah’s kings were **evil**, **corrupt**, and
they worshiped **idols**. Some of the kings even **sacrificed** their
children to false **gods**. Most of the people of Judah also **rebelled**
against God and worshiped other gods.

*A Bible story from: 1 Kings 1-6; 11-12*

Translation Notes:
------------------

-   **ruled justly** - This means they ruled according to God's laws.
    This can be translated as, “when they ruled, they did what was
    right.”
-   **corrupt** - This can be translated as, “did what was wrong in
    order to get whatever they wanted.”
-   *A Bible story from* - These references may be slightly different in
    some Bible translations.

God Sent the Prophets 19-01
=============================


**Throughout the history of** the **Israelites**, **God** sent them
**prophets**. The prophets heard messages from God and then told the
people God’s messages.

Translation Notes:
------------------

-   **Throughout the history of** - This expression means that God sent
    many prophets at many different times during all of the years that
    Israel and Judah existed.
-   **Israelites** - This could be translated here as, “the kingdoms of
    Israel and Judah.” All of the descendants of Jacob, including those
    in the kingdom of Judah, continued to be called “Israelites.”

Elijah Rebuked Ahab 19-02
===========================


**Elijah** was a **prophet** when **Ahab** was **king** over the
**kingdom of Israel**.  Ahab was an **evil** man who encouraged people
to **worship** a false **god** named **Baal**. Elijah said to Ahab,
“There will be no rain or dew in the kingdom of Israel **until I say
so**.” **This made Ahab very angry**.

Translation Notes:
------------------

-   **until I say so** - This may be translated as, “until I command the
    rain and dew to come again.”
-   **This made Ahab very angry** – This could be translated as, “When
    Ahab heard what Elijah said, he became very angry.”

God Provided for Elijah 19-03
===============================


**God** told **Elijah** to go to a stream in **the wilderness** to hide
from Ahab who wanted to kill him.  Every morning and every evening,
birds would bring him bread and meat.  **Ahab** and his army looked for
Elijah, but they could not find him. **The drought** was so severe that
the stream eventually dried up.

Translation Notes:
------------------

-   **the wilderness** - This was a remote location with very few
    people. This may also be translated as, “desert” or, “the
    bush.”
-   **The drought** - This could be translated as, “the lack of rain.”
    This drought was a result of Elijah declaring that there would be
    no rain.

God Provided for the Widow 19-04
==================================


So **Elijah** went to a **neighboring country**. A widow and her son in
that country had almost run out of food because of **the famine**. But
they **took care of** Elijah, and **God provided for them so that their
flour jar and their bottle of oil never became empty**. They had food
through the whole famine. Elijah stayed there for several years.

Translation Notes:
------------------

-   **neighboring country** - This refers to a country that was beside,
    or shared a border with Israel.
-   **the famine** - If needed, this could be translated as, “the famine
    caused by the drought.”
-   **took care of** – This means they gave him a place to stay in their
    house and provided food for him. It does not mean he was sick.
-   **God provided for them…never became empty** - This could be
    translated as, “God prevented their flour jar and their bottle
    of oil from becoming empty” or, “God caused…to never become
    empty.”
-   **flour jar** - This refers to a clay jar in which the widow kept
    her supply of flour.
-   **bottle of oil** - In Israel, olive oil is used for cooking. This
    could be translated as, “bottle of cooking oil.” The widow used
    the flour and the oil for making bread.

Elijah Challenged Ahab 19-05
==============================


After three and a half years, **God** told **Elijah** to return
to the **kingdom of Israel** and **speak with Ahab because he was
going to send** rain again. When Ahab saw Elijah he said, “There
you are, **you troublemaker**!” Elijah replied to him, “You are
the troublemaker! **You have abandoned Yahweh**, the true God, and
**worshiped** **Baal**. Bring all the people of the kingdom of Israel
to **Mount Carmel**.”

Translation Notes:
------------------

-   **speak with Ahab because he was going to send** – This could be
    translated as, “tell Ahab that God was going to send.”
-   **you troublemaker** - This means, “You are a troublemaker!” Ahab
    was accusing Elijah of causing trouble by telling the king that he
    was doing wrong and also by stopping the rain.
-   **You have abandoned Yahweh** - That is, Ahab had led Israel to stop
    worshiping and obeying Yahweh.
-   **Mount Carmel** - Mount Carmel is the name of a mountain located in
    northern Israel. It is over 500 meters high.

Elijah and the Prophets of Baal 19-06
=======================================


All the people of the **kingdom of Israel**, including the 450
**prophets** of **Baal**, came to **Mount Carmel**. **Elijah** said
to the people, “**How long will you** keep changing your mind? **If
Yahweh is God**, serve him! **If Baal is God**, serve him!”

Translation Notes:
------------------

-   **Mount Carmel** - See how you translated this in -   **How long
will you** - This is not a real question asking for
    information. Elijah was rebuking the Israelites for repeatedly
    changing their minds about whether they would serve Yahweh or Baal.
    Some languages will have to express this as a statement such as,
    “Stop changing your minds about whom you will worship!”
-   **If Yahweh is God…If Baal is God** - This does not mean that Elijah
    was undecided. He knew that Yahweh is the real God. He wanted the
    people to understand that when they worship false gods, they are
    rejecting Yahweh as the only true God. Translate this in a way that
    shows that the people had to make a choice.

A Sacrifice Without Fire 19-07
================================


Then **Elijah** said to the **prophets** of **Baal**, “Kill a bull and
prepare it as a **sacrifice**, but do not light the fire. I will do the
same. The **God who answers with fire** is **the real God**.” So the
**priests** of Baal prepared a sacrifice but did not light the fire.

Translation Notes:
------------------

-   **who answers with fire** - That is, “who supernaturally sends fire
    to burn up the sacrifice.”
-   **the real God** - This means the one and only true God.

Baal Did Not Answer 19-08
===========================


Then the **prophets** of **Baal** **prayed to Baal**, “Hear us, Baal!”
All day long they prayed and **shouted** and even **cut themselves with
knives**, but **there was no answer**.

Translation Notes:
------------------

-   **prayed to Baal** - the prophets of Baal asked Baal to send fire
    onto the bull they prepared as a sacrifice.
-   **shouted** - They yelled or called out loudly to Baal.  -   **cut
themselves with knives** - They injured themselves with knives
    as an extreme way to show their devotion to Baal, hoping that this
    would persuade him to listen to them.
-   **there was no answer** - There was no response of any kind to their
    shouting, and no fire came to burn up the sacrifice.

Elijah Prepared the Sacrifice 19-09
=====================================


At the end of the day, **Elijah** prepared a **sacrifice** to
**God**. Then he told the people to pour twelve huge pots of water on
top of the sacrifice until the meat, the wood, and even the ground around
the **altar** were completely wet.

Translation Notes:
------------------

-   **

The Prayer of Elijah 19-10
============================


Then **Elijah** **prayed**, “**Yahweh**, **God** of **Abraham**,
**Isaac**, and **Jacob**, **show us** today that you are the God of
**Israel** and that **I am your servant**. **Answer me** so that **these
people will know** that you are the **true** God.”

Translation Notes:
------------------

-   **show us** - That is, “prove to us” or, “demonstrate to us.”
-   **I am your servant** - This could be translated as, “You have given
    me authority to serve you and do these things.”
-   **Answer me** - That is, “respond to my prayer” or, “send
the fire
    that I have asked you for.”
-   **these people will know** - This may be translated as, “these
    people will see and understand.”

God Answered with Fire 19-11
==============================


Immediately, fire **fell from the sky** and burned up the meat,
the wood, the rocks, the dirt, and even the water that was around the
**altar**. When the people saw this, they **fell on the ground** and said,
“**Yahweh is God**! Yahweh is God!”

Translation Notes:
------------------

-   **fell from the sky** - This may be translated as, “suddenly came
    down from the sky.”
-   **fell on the ground** - They quickly lay down or knelt down on the
    ground. They were afraid of Yahweh because they had seen his power.
    They knew that only the true God could do that and bowed down to
    honor and worship him.
-   **Yahweh is God** - This expression means that they understood that
    Yahweh is the only God, not just one god among others.

Killing the Prophets of Baal 19-12
====================================


Then **Elijah** said, “Do not let any of the **prophets** of **Baal
escape**!” So the people **captured** the prophets of Baal. Then Elijah
took them away from there and killed them.

Translation Notes:
------------------

-   **escape** - The prophets of Baal tried to run away after their god
    was proven to be a false god.
-   **captured** – That is, “seized and held onto” or, “took
hold of.”

A Storm Ended the Drought 19-13
=================================


Then **Elijah** said to **King** **Ahab**, “Return immediately to the
city, because the rain is coming.” Soon **the sky grew black**, and a
heavy rain began.  **Yahweh** had ended the **drought** and proved that
he is the true **God**.

Translation Notes:
------------------

-   **the sky grew black** - That is, “the sky became very dark.”
Heavy
    rainclouds covered the sky, making it look dark grey or black.
-   **drought** – That is, “long dry time with no rain.”

Naaman Came to Elisha 19-14
=============================


After the time of **Elijah**, **God** chose a man named Elisha to be
his **prophet**.  God did many **miracles** through Elisha. One of
the miracles happened to **Naaman**, **an enemy commander**, who had a
horrible skin disease. **He had heard of Elisha** so **he went and asked
Elisha** to **heal** him. Elisha told Naaman to dip himself seven times
in the **Jordan River**.

Translation Notes:
------------------

-   **an enemy commander** - Naaman was a commander in the army of one
    of the countries that was Israel's enemy.
-   **He had heard of Elisha** - This means that people had told Naaman
    that Elisha was able to perform miracles.
-   **he went and asked Elisha** - That is, “he went to see Elisha and
    asked him.” Naaman had to go into Israel to find Elisha and ask
    him to do this.

Naaman Was Healed 19-15
=========================


At first **Naaman** was angry and **would not do it because it seemed
foolish**. But later **he changed his mind** and dipped himself seven
times in the **Jordan River**. When he came up the last time, his skin
was completely **healed**!  **God** had healed him.

Translation Notes:
------------------

-   **would not do it because it seemed foolish** - Naaman would not do
    what Elisha said because he knew that washing alone could not heal
    his disease.
-   **he changed his mind** - That is, “he decided to do what Elisha had
    told him to do.”

The Prophets Warned the People 19-16
======================================


**God** sent many other **prophets**. They all told the people to stop
**worshiping** **idols** and to **start showing justice and mercy**
to others. The prophets warned the people that if they did not stop
doing **evil** and start **obeying** God, then God would **judge**
them as **guilty**, and he would **punish** them.

Translation Notes:
------------------

-   **start showing justice and mercy** - This can be translated as,
    “start being just and merciful” or, “begin to demonstrate
    justice and mercy.”

Jeremiah Suffered for God 19-17
=================================


Most of the time, the people did not **obey** **God**. They often
mistreated the **prophets** and sometimes even killed them. Once,
the prophet **Jeremiah** was put into a **dry well** and left there
to die. He sank down into the mud that was in the bottom of the well,
but then the **king had mercy on him** and ordered his servants to pull
Jeremiah out of the well before he died.

Translation Notes:
------------------

-   **dry well** - The well did not currently have any water in it, but
    it did still have mud in the bottom. This could be translated as,
    “empty well.”
-   **had mercy on him** – This means he was kind to Jeremiah and helped
    him.

The Message of the Prophets 19-18
===================================


The **prophets continued to speak for God** even though the people
hated them. They warned people that God would destroy them if they did
not **repent**.  They also reminded people **of the promise that God’s
Messiah would come**.

*A Bible story from: 1 Kings 16-18; 2 Kings 5; Jeremiah 38*

Translation Notes:
------------------

-   **continued to speak for God** - That is, “continued to tell the
    people what God wanted to tell them.”

    translated as, “that God had promised that his Messiah would come
    to save his people.”
-   *A Bible story from* - These references may be slightly different in
    some Bible translations.

Israel Sinned 20-01
=====================


The **kingdom of Israel** and the **kingdom of Judah** both **sinned**
against **God**. They **broke the covenant** that God had made with
them at **Sinai**. God sent his **prophets** to **warn them to repent**
and **worship** him again, but they refused to **obey**.

Translation Notes:
------------------

-   **broke the covenant** - That is, “disobeyed the commands God had
    given them in his covenant with them at Mount Sinai.”
-   **warn them to repent and worship him again** – Another way to
    translate this would be, “tell them to stop sinning and to worship
    Yahweh instead of other gods, or terrible things would happen
    to them.”

Assyria Destroyed Israel 20-02
================================


So **God** **punished both kingdoms** by allowing their enemies to destroy
them. The **Assyrian Empire**, a powerful, cruel nation, destroyed the
**kingdom of Israel**.  The Assyrians killed many people in the kingdom of
Israel, **took away** everything of value, and burned much of the country.

Translation Notes:
------------------

-   **both kingdoms** - This refers to both the kingdoms of Israel and
    Judah.
-   **Empire** - A country was called an “empire” when it was powerful
    enough to extend its authority over many other countries.

    and carried them back to Assyria.

Israel Was Removed from the Land 20-03
========================================


The **Assyrians** gathered all the leaders, the rich people, and the
people with **skills** and took them to Assyria. Only the very poor
**Israelites** who had not been killed **remained** in the **kingdom
of Israel**.

Translation Notes:
------------------

-   **skills** – This refers to practical skills such as woodworking,
    metalworking, and building.
-   **remained** - That is, “stayed” or, “were left behind”
or, “were
    allowed to stay behind.”

Foreigners Were Brought to Israel 20-04
=========================================


Then the **Assyrians** brought **foreigners** to live in the land
where the **kingdom of Israel** had been. The foreigners rebuilt the
destroyed cities and married the **Israelites** who were left there. The
**descendants** of the Israelites who married foreigners were called
**Samaritans**.

Translation Notes:
------------------

-   **foreigners** - This refers to people who were not Israelites.

Judah also Worshiped Idols 20-05
==================================


The people in the **kingdom of Judah** saw how **God** had **punished**
the people of the **kingdom of Israel** **for not believing and obeying
him**. But they still **worshiped** **idols**, including the **gods**
of the **Canaanites**. God sent **prophets** to **warn them**, but **they
refused to listen**.

Translation Notes:
------------------

-   **for not believing and obeying him** – Another way to translate
    this would be, “because they did not believe or obey him.”

    things would happen to them.”
-   **they refused to listen** - That is, “they refused to obey” or

Judah Served Babylon 20-06
============================


About 100 years after the **Assyrians** destroyed the **kingdom
of Israel**, **God** sent **Nebuchadnezzar**, **king** of the
**Babylonians**, to attack the **kingdom of Judah**.  **Babylon** was a
powerful **empire**. The king of Judah agreed **to be Nebuchadnezzar’s
servant** and pay him a lot of money every year.

Translation Notes:
------------------

– The king of Judah was forced to either serve the
    Babylonian king or be destroyed.
-   **to be Nebuchadnezzar's servant** - This could be translated as,
    “to govern Judah under Nebuchadnezzar's command.”

Babylon Destroyed Judah 20-07
===============================


But after a few years, the king of **Judah rebelled** against
**Babylon**. So, the Babylonians **came back** and attacked the kingdom
of Judah. They **captured the city** of **Jerusalem**, destroyed the
**Temple**, and **took away** all the treasures of the city and the
Temple.

Translation Notes:
------------------

-   **came back** - This may also be translated as, “returned”

    Babylon.

The Kind of Judah Was Punished 20-08

**To punish** the **king** of **Judah** for rebelling,
**Nebuchadnezzar's** soldiers killed the king’s **sons in front of him**
and then **made him blind**. After that, they took the king away to die
in prison in **Babylon**.

Translation Notes:
------------------

-   **To punish** - Nebuchadnezzar punished the king of Judah by telling
    his soldiers to do these things.
-   **in front of him** - This may be translated as, “where he could
    see,” or “so that he could see it,” or “before his eyes.”
-   **made him blind** - This may also be translated as, “destroyed his
    eyes.”

Judah Was Taken to Babylon 20-09
==================================


**Nebuchadnezzar** and his army took almost all of the people of the
**kingdom of Judah** to **Babylon**, **leaving only the poorest people
behind** to plant the fields. **This period of time** when **God's**
people were forced to leave the **Promised Land** is called the **Exile**.

Translation Notes:
------------------

-   **leaving…behind** - That is, “leaving only the poorest people in
    Judah” or, “letting only the poorest people stay in Judah.”
-   **This period of time** - To translate this, choose a phrase that
    can refer to a long time, since this exile period lasted seventy
    years.
-   **Exile** - The word “exile” means someone is removed from they
    country by force. The “Exile” is the term for this 70-year period
    when the Israelites were forced to live in Babylon.

God Remembered His Promise 20-10
==================================


Even though **God** **punished** his people for their **sin** by
taking them away into **exile**, he **did not forget** them or his
**promises**. God continued to **watch over** his people and **speak
to them through his prophets**. He promised that, after seventy years,
they would return to the **Promised Land** again.

Translation Notes:
------------------

-   **exile** - See how you translated this term in -   **did not forget**
- This could be translated as, “did not ignore”
    or, “did not neglect.” Or the whole phrase could be translated
    as, “continued to honor his commitment to his people and his
    promises.”
-   **watch over** - That is, “take care of.” -   **speak to them
through his prophets** - This could be translated
    as, “tell his prophets messages that he wanted them to tell his
    people.”

Persia Defeated Babylon 20-11
===============================


About **seventy years later**, **Cyrus**, the **king** of the
**Persians**, defeated **Babylon**, so the Persian Empire replaced the
Babylonian Empire. **The Israelites were now called Jews** and most of
them had lived their whole lives in Babylon. Only a few very old Jews
even remembered **the land of Judah**.

Translation Notes:
------------------

-   **seventy years later** - This refers to the seventy years that had
    passed since the Babylonian army took the people of Jerusalem
    into exile.
-   **Cyrus** - Cyrus was also called, “Cyrus the Great.” The name
    “Cyrus” meant “like the sun” in the Persian language. However,
    since Cyrus was an important historical person, it might be best to
    transliterate his name, rather than translating the meaning.
-   **Persians** - The Persian Empire grew to cover the area from
    central Asia to Egypt. Its home was located in the general area of
    modern-day Iran.
-   **The Israelites were now called Jews** - This could also be
    translated as, “People now called the Israelites by the name
    'Jews.'”
-   **the land of Judah** - That is, the area where the kingdom of Judah
    was located before the Exile. Jerusalem was the capital city of Judah.

Cyrus Sent Judah Home 20-12
=============================


The **Persian Empire** was strong but **merciful** to the people it
conquered. Shortly after **Cyrus** became king of the Persians, he
gave an order that any **Jew** who wanted **to return to Judah** could
leave Persia and go back to Judah. He even gave them money to rebuild
the **Temple**! So, after seventy years in **exile**, a small group of
Jews **returned** to the city of **Jerusalem** in Judah.

Translation Notes:
------------------

-   **Persian Empire** - See how you translated this term in -   **Cyrus**
- See how you translated his name in -   **Judah** - See the note about
Judah in -   **to return to Judah** - Since most of these Jews were
the children
    and grandchildren of those who left Judah, they had never lived in
    Judah before. In some languages it might be better to say “to go
    to Judah.”
-   **exile** - See how you translated this term in -   **returned**
– That is, “went back.” Some languages may prefer to
    say, “went” since most of these people had never been to
    Jerusalem.

The Temple Was Rebuilt 20-13
==============================


When **the people** arrived in **Jerusalem**, they rebuilt the **Temple**
and **the wall** around the city. Although they were still **ruled
by other people**, **once again** they lived in the **Promised Land**
and **worshiped at the Temple**.

*A Bible story from: 2 Kings 17; 24-25; 2 Chronicles 36; Ezra 1-10;
Nehemiah 1-13*

Translation Notes:
------------------

-   **the people** - That is, the Israelites, the descendants of Jacob,
    who were now called the Jews.
-   **the wall** - This wall was very thick  and was built
    to protect the city from attackers.
-   **ruled by other people** - That is, another nation controlled them.
    The Jews were ruled by the Persians at this time, and later by
    other nations.
-   **once again** - In some languages this might need to be translated
    as, “now” or, “as their ancestors had done” or, “just as
    before the Exile.”
-   **worshiped at the Temple** - They worshiped Yahweh, the One True
    God, at the Temple they rebuilt.
-   *A Bible story from* - These references may be slightly different in
    some Bible translations.

Messiah Will Defeat Satan 21-01
=================================


**From the very beginning**, **God** planned to send the **Messiah**. The
first **promise** of the Messiah came to **Adam** and **Eve**. God
promised that a **descendant** of Eve would be born who would **crush the
snake’s head**. **The snake who deceived Eve was Satan**.  The promise
meant that the Messiah would defeat Satan completely.

Translation Notes:
------------------

-   **From the very beginning** - That is, from when the earth was first
    created.
-   **crush the snake’s head** - Unless the head of a venomous snake is
    crushed, the snake can still hurt someone. Use a word for “crush”
    that communicates that its head is destroyed.
-   **The snake…was Satan** – Satan spoke to Eve in the form of
a snake.
    This does not mean that he is a snake now. This could be translated
    as, “The snake…was an appearance of Satan.”
-   **who deceived Eve** - That is, “who lied to Eve.” The snake
lied by
    making Eve doubt what God had said and tricking her into disobeying
    God.

A Promise for the Whole World 21-02
=====================================


**God** promised **Abraham** that **through him** all **people groups**
of the world would receive a **blessing**. This blessing would be
**fulfilled** when the **Messiah** would come sometime in the future. He
would make it possible for people from every people groups in the world
to be **saved**.

Translation Notes:
------------------

-   **through him** – That is, “because of one of his descendants.”

A Prophet Like Moses 21-03
============================


**God** **promised** **Moses** that in the future he would **raise
up another prophet like Moses**.  This was another promise about the
**Messiah** who would come at some later time.

Translation Notes:
------------------

-   **raise up another prophet like Moses** - That is, “appoint another
    prophet like Moses” or, “cause another prophet to come who would
    be like Moses.”
-   **prophet like Moses** - To be like Moses, the future prophet would
    need to have great authority from God to lead and rescue his people.

A Descendant of David 21-04
=============================


**God** **promised** **King David** that the **Messiah** would be one
of **David’s own descendants**.

Translation Notes:
------------------

-   **David's own descendants** - Another way to say this would be, “a
    direct descendant of David himself.”

The New Covenant 21-05
========================


**Through the prophet Jeremiah**, **God** **promised** that he would
make a **New Covenant**, **but not like** the **covenant** God made
with **Israel** at **Sinai**. In the New Covenant, God would **write
his law on the people’s hearts**, the people would **know God**
personally, they would **be his people**, and God would **forgive**
their **sins**. The **Messiah** would **start the New Covenant**.

Translation Notes:
------------------

-   **Through the prophet Jeremiah God promised** – This could be
    translated as, “Through the messages that God gave to Jeremiah,
    God promised” or, “The prophet Jeremiah told the people God's
    promise.”
-   **but not like** - The New Covenant would be truly effective. People
    really would know God, they would truly live as his people, and He
    would forgive their sins completely, based on the Messiah's sacrifice
    of himself one time for all who believe in him.
-   **write his law on the people’s hearts** - This is a metaphor
    meaning, “help his people to understand his laws and to earnestly
    desire to obey them.” If possible, keep the image of writing on
    their hearts, since this is in contrast with the way God had written
    his law on stone tablets for the Israelites. If that is not possible,
    you could just translate the meaning.
-   **be his people** - This could be translated as, “be his special
    people” or, “be his favored people.”
-   **start the New Covenant** - That is, “be the one to cause the New
    Covenant to take effect” or, “bring the New Covenant to his
    people.”

Prophet, Priest and King 21-06
================================


**God's** **prophets** also said that the **Messiah** would be a prophet,
a **priest**, and a **king**. A prophet is a person who hears the words
of God and then proclaims God’s words to the people. The Messiah that
God promised to send would be the **perfect prophet**.

Translation Notes:
------------------

-   **perfect prophet** - The Messiah would be a prophet who is perfect
    in obedience to God, giving every word God would speak to the
    people. He would present God perfectly to the people, helping them
    to know and understand God.

The Perfect High Priest 21-07
===============================


**Israelite** **priests** made **sacrifices** to **God on behalf of** the
people **as a substitute for the punishment for their sins**. Priests also
**prayed** to God for the people. The **Messiah** would be the **perfect
high priest** who would **offer himself** as a **perfect sacrifice**
to God.

Translation Notes:
------------------

-   **on behalf of** - This may be translated as, “for the benefit of”
    or, “in the place of.”
-   **as a substitute for the punishment for their sins** - God allowed
    people to bring animals to sacrifice for their sin as a reminder
    of the punishment that they deserved and their dependence on God
    to remove their sin. God accepted these sacrifices as a temporary
    covering for sin and did not punish the people for it.
-   **perfect high priest** - Unlike the other high priests, the Messiah
    would never sin, and he would permanently take away all the sins of
    the people.
-   **offer himself** – That is, “allow himself to be killed.” -
**perfect sacrifice** - That is, “a sacrifice that has no fault or
    imperfection.”

Messiah Will Rule Forever 21-08
=================================


A **king** is someone who rules over a **kingdom** and **judges**
the people.  The **Messiah** would be the perfect king who would **sit
on the throne** of his ancestor **David**. He would reign over **the
whole world** forever, and would always judge honestly and make the
right decisions.

Translation Notes:
------------------

-   **sit on the throne of his ancestor David** - A throne is a
    ceremonial chair for a king or queen that represents their
    authority. This expression could also be translated as, “have the
    authority to reign as his ancestor King David did” or, “be the
    descendant of King David and continue his rule over God's people.”
-   **the whole world** - This could also be translated as, “everyone
    everywhere.”

The Virgin Birth 21-09
========================


**God's** **prophets** predicted many other things about the
**Messiah**. The prophet **Malachi** **foretold** that a great prophet
would come before the Messiah came. The prophet **Isaiah** **prophesied**
that **the Messiah would be born from a virgin**. The prophet **Micah**
said that he would be born in the town of **Bethlehem**.

Translation Notes:
------------------

-   **Malachi** - Malachi was the last prophet in the Old Testament.
-   **foretold** - This could be translated as, “predicted” or,
    “prophesied.” It means to tell something that will happen in the
    future. Malachi spoke God's message to the people 400 years before
    the Messiah came.
-   **prophesied** – In this context, “prophesied” has the same
meaning
    as “foretold” and “predicted” since it means the prophet
    told something that would happen far in the future.
-   **the Messiah would be born from a virgin** - Another way to say
    this would be, “a virgin would give birth to the Messiah.”
-   **Micah** - Micah was an Old Testament prophet of God who, like
    Isaiah, spoke his messages from God almost 800 years before the
    Messiah came.

Messiah Will Heal 21-10
=========================


The **prophet** **Isaiah** said the Messiah would live in **Galilee**,
comfort **broken-hearted people**, and **proclaim freedom to captives**
and **release to prisoners**. He also predicted that the **Messiah**
would **heal** sick people and those who **could not hear, see, speak,
or walk**.

Translation Notes:
------------------

-   **broken-hearted people** - This expression refers to people who are
    experiencing extreme sadness.
-   **proclaim freedom to captives** - That is, “tell slaves they could
    be free.” This could also refer to freeing people from slavery
    to sin.
-   **release to prisoners** - That is, “he will set free those who have
    unjustly been put into prison.” This could also refer to setting
    people free from the bondage of sin.
-   **could not hear, see, speak, or walk** – It may be better to say,
    “could not hear, could not see, could not speak, or could not
    walk.” Some languages have special words for these conditions,
    such as “deaf” and “blind.”

Messiah Will Be Betrayed 21-11
================================


The **prophet** **Isaiah** also **prophesied** that the **Messiah** would
be **hated without reason and rejected**. Other prophets **foretold**
that those who killed the Messiah would **gamble for his clothes** and
that a friend would **betray** him. The prophet **Zechariah** predicted
that the friend would be paid **thirty silver coins** as payment for
betraying the Messiah.

Translation Notes:
------------------

-   **hated without reason and rejected** - This could be translated as,
    “hated and rejected, even though he had done nothing wrong” or
    “…even though he was innocent.”
-   **foretold** – This means they told about things that would happen
    in the future. Other words that have a similar meaning are,
    “predicted” and “prophesied.”
-   **gamble for his clothes** - That is, “play a game of chance to
    determine who would win his clothes.”
-   **Zechariah** - Zechariah was an Old Testament prophet who spoke to
    God's people after they returned to the Promised Land from the Exile
    in Babylon. This was about 500 years before the Messiah came.
-   **thirty silver coins** - At the time, each of these coins was worth
    the amount of money a person could earn in four days.

The Death of the Messiah 21-12
================================


The **prophets** also told about how the **Messiah** would **die**.
**Isaiah** **prophesied** that people would spit on, mock, and beat the
Messiah. They would **pierce** him and he would die in great suffering
and agony, even though he had not done anything wrong.

Translation Notes:
------------------

-   **pierce** - That is, “stab.” Sharp objects would penetrate
his body
    as part of the punishment for people's sin.

The Messiah Will Bring Peace 21-13
====================================


The **prophets** also said that the **Messiah** would be perfect,
**having no sin**. He would **die** to **receive the punishment for other
people’s sin**. His punishment would bring **peace** between **God**
and people. For this reason, **it was God's will to crush the Messiah**.

Translation Notes:
------------------

-   **having no sin** - This can also be translated as “he never
    sinned.”
-   **receive the punishment for other people’s sin** - That is, “to
    take on himself the punishment that other people deserved” or,
    “to be punished in the place of other people.”
-   **it was God's will** - That is, “it fulfilled God's purpose.”
This
    phrase means that the Messiah's death was exactly what God had
    planned to happen in order that his sacrifice would pay for the sins
    of the people.
-   **to crush** - That is, “to damage completely,” “to kill”
or, “to
    completely destroy.”

Resurrection of the Messiah 21-14
===================================


The **prophets** foretold that the **Messiah** would **die** and that
**God** would also **raise him from the dead**.  **Through the Messiah’s
death and resurrection, God would** accomplish his plan to **save**
**sinners** and **start the New Covenant**.

Translation Notes:
------------------

-   **raise him from the dead** - That is, “cause him to be alive
    again.”
-   **Through the Messiah’s death and resurrection, God would** - This
    could also be translated as, “God would use the Messiah's death
    and resurrection to” or “The Messiah's death and resurrection
    would be the way that God would.”
-   **start the New Covenant** – That is, “put the New Covenant into
    effect.”

At the Perfect Time 21-15
===========================


**God** revealed to the **prophets** many things about the **Messiah**,
but the Messiah did not come during the time of any of those prophets.
More than 400 years after the last of these prophecies was given, at
exactly the right time, God would send the Messiah **into the world**.

*A Bible story from: Genesis 3:15; 12:1-3; Deuteronomy 18:15; 2 Samuel 7;
Jeremiah 31; Isaiah 59:16; Daniel 7; Malachi 4:5; Isaiah 7:14; Micah 5:2;
Isaiah 9:1-7; 35:3-5; 61; 53; Psalm 22:18; 35:19; 69:4; 41:9; Zechariah
11:12-13; Isaiah 50:6; Psalm 16:10-11*

Translation Notes:
------------------

-   **into the world** - This could be translated as, “to the people of
    the world.” The Messiah would be sent not only to the Jews, but
    to all people.
-   *A Bible story from* - These references may be slightly different in
    some Bible translations.

God Spoke to Zechariah 22-01
==============================


In the past, **God** had spoken to **his people** through his **angels**
and **prophets**. But then **400 years went by when he did not speak
to them**. Suddenly an angel came with a message from God to an old
**priest** named **Zechariah**.  Zechariah and his wife, Elizabeth,
were **godly people**, but she had not been able to have any children.

Translation Notes:
------------------

-   **his people** - This could be translated as, “his people, the
    Israelites” or “his people, the Jews.” But only include the
    added information if it is not clearly understood who these people
    were.
-   **400 years went by** - Another way to say this would be, “400 years
    passed” or “there were 400 years.” 400 years had passed since
    the last Old Testament prophet, Malachi.
-   **when he did not speak to them** – That is, “during which God did
    not give any messages to the prophets for his people.”
-   **godly people** - That is, “people who obeyed God.”

You Will Have a Son 22-02
===========================


**The angel** said to **Zechariah**, “Your wife will have a son. You
will name him **John**. He will be **filled with the Holy Spirit**, and
will **prepare the people for the Messiah**!” Zechariah responded,
“My wife and I are too old to have children! How will I know this
will happen?”

Translation Notes:
------------------

-   **The angel** - This refers to the angel that came to Zechariah in -
**filled with the Holy Spirit** - That is, “controlled by the Holy
    Spirit” or, “given wisdom and power by the Holy Spirit.”
-   **How will I know this will happen?** - Another way to translate
    this would be, “How can I be sure that this will truly happen?”

Unable to Speak 22-03
=======================


The **angel** responded to Zechariah, “I was sent by **God** to bring
you this good news. Because you did not **believe** me, you will not
be able to speak until the child is born.” Immediately, **Zechariah**
was unable to speak. Then the angel left Zechariah. After this, Zechariah
returned home and his wife **became pregnant**.

Translation Notes:
------------------

-   **became pregnant** - Some languages have polite ways of saying
    “become pregnant.” Use an expression that will not be embarrassing
    to readers.

An Angel Spoke to Mary 22-04
==============================


When **Elizabeth** was **six months pregnant**, the same **angel**
suddenly appeared to **Elizabeth’s relative**, whose name was
**Mary**. She was a **virgin** and **was engaged** to be married to a
man named **Joseph**. The angel said, “You will become pregnant and
give birth to a son. You are to name him **Jesus** and he will be the
**Messiah**.”

Translation Notes:
------------------

-   **six months pregnant** - Either she had already been pregnant for
    six months or she was in the sixth month of her pregnancy.
-   **pregnant** - Different languages have different idioms to talk
    about pregnancy, such as “she was with child” or, “she had one
    in her body” or, “she had belly.” Some languages have special
    ways of speaking about it politely, such as “she was expecting.”
    Use an expression that will not be embarrassing to readers.
-   **Elizabeth** - She was Zechariah's wife. An angel told Zechariah
    that Elizabeth would give birth to a son.
-   **Elizabeth’s relative** - Many translations say, “cousin”
here but
    we don't know exactly how these two women were related. A general
    term like, “relative,” “kin” or, “cousin” could be used.
-   **was engaged** - That is, “was promised.”

The Mother of the Messiah 22-05
=================================


**Mary** replied, “**How can this be**, since I am a **virgin**?”
The **angel** explained, “The **Holy Spirit** will **come to you, and
the power of God will overshadow you**. So the baby will be **holy**,
the **Son of God**.” Mary **believed** and accepted what the angel said.

Translation Notes:
------------------

-   **How can this be** - That is, “How can I become pregnant?”
Mary was
    not doubting the truth of the angel's words, but asking how it
    would happen.
-   **Holy Spirit will come to you, and the power of God will overshadow
    you** - These are two ways of saying the same thing: “By the
    power of God, the Holy Spirit will miraculously cause you to become
    pregnant.” Make sure the translation of this sentence does not sound
    like there was any physical contact involved. This was a miracle.

Mary and Elizabeth 22-06
==========================


Soon after the **angel** spoke to **Mary**, she went and visited
**Elizabeth**. **As soon as Elizabeth heard Mary’s greeting**,
Elizabeth’s **baby jumped inside her**. The women rejoiced together
about **what God had done for them**. After Mary visited Elizabeth for
three months, Mary returned home.

Translation Notes:
------------------

-   **Elizabeth** - See the note about Elizabeth on -   **As soon as
Elizabeth heard Mary’s greeting** - For some languages
    it may be better to say, “Mary greeted Elizabeth and as soon as
    Elizabeth heard her.”
-   **baby jumped inside her** - The baby moved suddenly inside
    Elizabeth's womb in response to Mary's greeting to Elizabeth.
-   **what God had done for them** - This refers to the fact that both
    women were pregnant through God's supernatural intervention. Mary had
    conceived without a man, and Elizabeth had conceived with Zechariah
    after she was past the age of childbearing.

The Birth of John 22-07
=========================


After **Elizabeth** gave birth to her baby boy, **Zechariah** and
Elizabeth named the baby **John**, as the **angel** had commanded.
Then **God** allowed **Zechariah** to speak again. Zechariah said,
“**Praise God**, because he has remembered his people! You, my son,
**will be called** **the prophet** of the **Most High God** who will
prepare the people to receive the **Messiah**!”

*A Bible story from: Luke 1*

Translation Notes:
------------------

-   **Elizabeth** - See the note about Elizabeth on -   **Praise God**
- That is, “We should all praise God.” -   **will be called** -
This is another way of saying, “will be” or,
    “will be known as.” John would actually be the Prophet of the
    Most High God.
-   **the prophet** - That is, “the very important prophet.” John
would
    be the prophet that the Old Testament prophets had predicted would
    come before the Messiah.
-   **Most High God** - Another way to say this would be, “the God who
    is greater than everything” or, “the God who rules over
    everything.”
-   *A Bible story from* - These references may be slightly different in
    some Bible translations.

Mary Was Pregnant 23-01
=========================


**Mary** was engaged to a **righteous** man named **Joseph**.  When he
heard that Mary was pregnant, **he knew it was not his baby**.  He did not
want **to shame Mary**, so **he planned to quietly divorce her**. Before
he could do that, an **angel** came and spoke to him **in a dream**.

Translation Notes:
------------------

-   **he knew it was not his baby** - That is, “he knew that he was not
    the one who had caused her to be pregnant.”
-   **to shame Mary** - That is, “to cause Mary to be publicly
    disgraced” or “to embarrass Mary publicly.” Joseph was merciful
    to Mary, even though it seemed like she was an adulterer.
-   **he planned to quietly divorce her** - This could also be
    translated as, “He planned to divorce her without telling others
    why,” or, “He planned to divorce her without telling others about
    her pregnancy.” Because Joseph was righteous, he wanted to resolve
    the situation in the best way possible, which in this culture would
    be to divorce her quietly.
-   **divorce her** - For some languages it may be better to say, “break
    their engagement.” Joseph and Mary were engaged or, “pledged
    to be married.” But in Jewish culture a divorce was required in
    order to break off an engagement.
-   **in a dream** – That is, “while he was asleep and dreaming.”

Take Mary As Your Wife 23-02
==============================

!Joseph sleeping, angel appearing in

The **angel** said, “**Joseph**, **do not be afraid to take Mary as
your wife**. The baby that is in her **is from the Holy Spirit**. She
will give birth to a **son**.  Name him **Jesus** (which means, '**Yahweh
saves, because he will save the people from their **sins**.”

Translation Notes:
------------------

-   **do not be afraid to take Mary as your wife** - This can also be
    translated as, “Stop thinking that you shouldn't marry Mary” or,
    “Do not hesitate to have Mary as your wife.”
-   **is from the Holy Spirit** - That is, “was conceived by a miracle
    of the Holy Spirit.”

Joseph Married Mary 23-03
===========================


So **Joseph** married **Mary** and took her home as his wife, but **he
did not sleep with her** until she had given birth.

Translation Notes:
------------------

-   **he did not sleep with her** - That is, “he did not have sexual
    relations with her.” He kept her a virgin until the birth of
    the baby.

The Trip to Bethlehem 23-04
=============================


**When the time was near for Mary to give birth**, the **Roman
government** told everyone to go **for a census** to the town where their
ancestors had lived. **Joseph** and Mary had to make a long journey from
where they lived in **Nazareth** to **Bethlehem** because their ancestor
was **David** whose hometown was Bethlehem.

Translation Notes:
------------------

-   **When the time was near for Mary to give birth** - That is, “When
    it was near the end of Mary's pregnancy.”
-   **Roman government** - Rome had conquered and ruled over Israel at
    this time.
-   **for a census** - That is, “to be counted for the government
    record” or, “so that the government could write their names on
    a list” or, “to be counted by the government.” This census
    was probably made for the purpose of taxing the people.

The Birth of Jesus 23-05
==========================


When they arrived in **Bethlehem**, there was **no place to stay**. The
only room they could find was a **place where animals stayed**. The
baby was born there and his mother laid him in a **feeding trough**,
since they did not have a bed for him. They named him **Jesus**.

Translation Notes:
------------------

-   **no place to stay** - That is, “no usual place to stay.” Because
    Bethlehem was so crowded at that time, the usual rooms for guests
    were already full of people.
-   **place where animals stayed** - This was a place for sheltering
    animals, not a place where people lived. Translate this with a term
    that would normally be used for a place where animals were kept.
-   **feeding trough** - That is, “animal feed box” or, “wooden
or stone
    box for feeding animals.” The box could have been filled with hay
    to provide a padded surface for the baby to lie on.

The Angel and the Shepherds 23-06
===================================


That night, there were some **shepherds** in a nearby field **guarding
their flocks**. Suddenly, **a shining angel** appeared to them,
and **they were terrified**. The angel said, “**Do not be afraid**,
because I have some good news for you. The **Messiah**, the **Master**,
has been born in **Bethlehem**!”

Translation Notes:
------------------

-   **guarding their flocks** - A “flock” is a group of sheep. The
    shepherds were caring for their sheep, and protecting them from harm
    or theft.
-   **a shining angel** - This could also be translated as, “an angel
    surrounded by a bright light.” The shining light would have seemed
    even brighter in contrast to the darkness of the night.
-   **they were terrified** - The appearance of the supernatural angel
    was extremely frightening.
-   **Do not be afraid** - This often means, “stop being afraid.” The
    shepherds were very afraid when they saw the angel so he was telling
    them they did not need to be afraid.

The Angels Praised God 23-07
==============================


“Go search for the baby, and you will find him **wrapped in pieces
of cloth** and lying in a feeding trough.” Suddenly, the skies were
**filled with angels** praising **God**, saying, “**Glory to God**
in **heaven** and **peace on earth** to **the people he favors**!”

Translation Notes:
------------------

- -   **wrapped in pieces of cloth** - The custom of that time was to
    tightly wrap newborn babies in long strips of cloth. It may be
    necessary to say, “wrapped in long strips of cloth, in the
    customary way.”
-   **feeding trough** - That is, “animal feeding box.” Also see
how you
    translated this in
-   **filled with angels** - This means that there were so many angels
    that they seemed to fill the sky.
-   **Glory to God** - This can also be translated as, “Let us all give
    glory to God!” or, “Our God deserves all glory and honor!” or,
    “We all give glory to God!”
-   **peace on earth** - Another way to say this would be, “may there be
    peace on earth.”
-   **the people he favors** - This might be translated as, “people that
    God looks upon with favor, delight, or good will.”

The Shepherds Visited Jesus 23-08
===================================


The **shepherds** soon arrived at the place where **Jesus** was and they
found him lying in a feeding trough, just as the **angel** had told them.
They were very excited.  **Mary** was very happy, too.  The shepherds
returned to the fields where their sheep were, **praising** **God**
for **all they had heard and seen**.

Translation Notes:
------------------

-   **all they had heard and seen** - That is, “for everything they had
    heard and seen.” This included the glorious angels and their
    amazing message, as well as seeing the newborn Messiah himself.

The Wise Men Visited Jesus 23-09
==================================


**Some time later**, **wise men** from countries far to the east saw an
**unusual star** in the sky.  **They realized** it meant a new **king of
the Jews** had been born. So, they traveled a great distance to see this
king. They came to **Bethlehem** and found **the house** where **Jesus**
and his parents were staying.

Translation Notes:
------------------

-   **Some time later** - It is not clear how long it was after the
    birth of Jesus before the wise men saw the star, but it may have
    taken as long as two years for them to prepare for the trip and then
    travel to Bethlehem.
-   **wise men** - The “wise men” were probably astrologers who
studied
    the stars. They may also have had access to the Old Testament
    prophets' writings that predicted the birth of the Messiah.
-   **unusual star** - The star that they noticed was not a normal star.
    It was something that appeared at the time of Jesus' birth.
-   **They realized** - Some languages may add, “From their studies,
    these scholars realized.”
-   **the house** - They were no longer staying in the place for animals
    where he was born.

Worship for the Baby 23-10
============================


When the **wise men** saw **Jesus** with his mother, they **bowed down**
and **worshiped** him. They gave Jesus **expensive** gifts. Then they
returned home.

*A Bible story from: Matthew 1; Luke 2*

Translation Notes:
------------------

-   **wise men** - See how you translated this term in -   **bowed down**
- That is, “bowed low to the ground.” At that time,
    this was the customary way of showing great respect or reverence.
-   **expensive** – That is, “very valuable.” -   *A Bible story
from* - These references may be slightly different in
    some Bible translations.

John the Prophet 24-01
========================


**John**, the son of **Zechariah** and Elizabeth, grew up and became
a **prophet**. He lived in the **wilderness**, ate **wild honey** and
**locusts**, and wore **clothes made from camel hair**.

Translation Notes:
------------------

-   **wilderness** - That is, “the desert” or, “a remote,
desert-like
    place.” There were few people living out in this area.
-   **wild honey** - This honey was the natural product of bees in the
    wilderness; it was not cultivated by people. If that is what people
    would understand by the word “honey,” you may not need to call
    it “wild.”
-   **locusts** - These were large, hopping insects with wings, like
    very large grasshoppers. Some people who live in the desert eat them.
-   **camel hair** - A camel is an animal that has very rough hair.
    People could make clothing out of it. This could be translated as
    “rough animal hair.”
-   **clothes made from camel hair** - That is, “coarse clothes made of
    camel hair.” These clothes would not quickly wear out in the
    wilderness as other clothes would.

A Call to Repent 24-02
========================


Many people came out to the **wilderness** to listen to **John**. He
**preached** to them, saying, “**Repent**, for **the kingdom of God
is near**!”

Translation Notes:
------------------

-   **wilderness** - See how you translated this word in -   **Repent**
- It might be better to say, “Repent from your sins.” -   **the
kingdom of God is near** - That is, “the kingdom of God is
    ready to appear” or, “the kingdom of God will arrive soon.” This
    refers to God's ruling over people. This can also be translated as,
    “God's reign is about to begin” or, “God will soon rule over
    us as king.”

A Baptism of Repentance 24-03
===============================


When people heard **John's** message, many of them **repented from their
sins**, and John **baptized** them. Many **religious leaders** also
came to be baptized by John, but they **did not repent** or **confess
their sins**.

Translation Notes:
------------------

-   **repented from their sins** - This could also be translated as,
    “repented concerning their sins” or, “changed their minds
    about their sins” or, “turned away from their sins.”
-   **did not repent** - That is, “did not turn away from their sins.”
-   **confess their sins** - To confess is to acknowledge that something
    is true. These leaders did not want to acknowledge that they had
    sinned. This may be translated as, “confess that they had sinned.”

Preparing the Way 24-04
=========================


**John** said to the **religious leaders**, “**You poisonous snakes**!
**Repent** and change your behavior. **Every tree that does not
bear good fruit** **will be cut down and thrown into the fire**.”
**John fulfilled** what the **prophets** said, “**See**, I send **my
messenger** **ahead of you**, who will **prepare your way**.”

Translation Notes:
------------------

-   **You poisonous snakes** - This could be translated as, “You are
    like lying poisonous snakes!” John was calling them poisonous
    snakes because they were dangerous and deceptive.
-   **Every tree that does not bear good fruit** - John is not really
    talking about trees. This is an expression that compares good fruit
    to good actions and attitudes that come from God.
-   **will be cut down and thrown into the fire** – This means,
“will be
    judged and punished by God.”
-   **John fulfilled** - That is, “John was doing” what the prophet
said
    God's messenger would do.
-   **See** - This could be translated as “Look and see” or, “Pay
    attention!”
-   **my messenger** - That is, “I, Yahweh, will send my messenger.”
In
    some languages it would be more natural to use an indirect quote
    for this sentence, such as: “what the prophet Isaiah predicted
    when he said that God would send his messenger.”
-   **ahead of you** - In this phrase, the word “you” refers to the
    Messiah.
-   **prepare your way** - God's messenger will prepare the people to
    listen to the Messiah.

Not the Messiah 24-05
=======================


Some **Jews** asked **John** if he was the **Messiah**.  John replied,
“I am not the Messiah, but there is someone coming after me. **He is
so great** that I am **not even worthy to untie his sandals**.”

Translation Notes:
------------------

-   **He is so great** - This could be translated as, “He is so
    important.”
-   **not even worthy to untie his sandals** - In other words, “compared
    to him, I am not important enough to do even the most menial task
    for him.” Untying sandals was a very low job, something a slave
    would do.

Jesus Is the Lamb of God 24-06
================================


The next day, **Jesus** came to be **baptized** by **John**. When John
saw him, he said, “Look! **There is** the **Lamb of God** who **will
take away** the **sin of the world**.”

Translation Notes:
------------------

-   **There is** – For some languages this would be, “Here is”
or, “That
    man is.”
-   **Lamb of God** - This could also be translated as, “the Lamb from
    God” or, “the sacrifice Lamb that God has provided.” Jesus
    was the perfect sacrifice for sin that God promised to provide. He
    fulfills the image that was presented by the sacrifice of lambs in
    the Old Testament.
-   **will take away** - The sacrifice of Jesus causes God to look at
    our sin as if it never existed.
-   **sin of the world** - That is, “the sin of the people in the
    world.”

John Baptized Jesus 24-07
===========================


**John** said to **Jesus**, “**I am not worthy to baptize you**.
You should baptize me instead.” But Jesus said, “You should baptize
me, because **it is the right thing to do**.” So John baptized him,
even though Jesus had never **sinned**.

Translation Notes:
------------------

-   **I am not worthy to baptize you** - This could be translated as, “I
    am not good enough to baptize you” or, “I am sinful, so I should
    not baptize you.”
-   **it is the right thing to do** - This might also be translated as,
    “it is the proper thing to do” or, “this is what God wants me
    to do.”

You Are My Beloved Son 24-08
==============================


When **Jesus** came up out of the water after being **baptized**, the
**Spirit of God appeared in the form of a dove** and came down and rested
on him. At the same time, God's voice spoke from **heaven**, saying,
“You are **my Son whom I love**, and I am very pleased with you.”

Translation Notes:
------------------

-   **my Son whom I love** - Make sure the translation of this does not
    sound like there was another son. It may be necessary to say, “You
    are my Son. I love you very much and am very pleased with you.”

Jesus Is the Son of God 24-09
===============================


**God had told John**, “The **Holy Spirit** **will come down and rest
on** someone you **baptize**. That person is the **Son of God**.”
There is only one God. But John heard **God the Father** speak, and saw
**Jesus** the **Son** and the Holy Spirit when he baptized Jesus.

*A Bible story from: Matthew 3; Mark 1:9-11; Luke 3:1-23*

Translation Notes:
------------------

-   **God had told John** - That is, “Before this, God had told John”
    or, “Before Jesus came to be baptized, God had told John.”
-   *A Bible story from* - These references may be slightly different in
    some Bible translations.

Satan Tempted Jesus 25-01
===========================


Immediately after **Jesus** was **baptized**, **the Holy Spirit led him**
out into **the wilderness**, where he **fasted** for **forty days and
forty nights**. Then **Satan** came to Jesus and **tempted him to sin**.

Translation Notes:
------------------

-   **the Holy Spirit led him** – That is, “the Holy Spirit guided
him”
    or, “the Holy Spirit prompted him to go.”
-   **the wilderness** - This could also be translated as, “the
desert”
    or, “a remote, barren place with few people.” This place probably
    had very few trees or other plants, so most people would not be able
    to live there.
-   **forty days and forty nights** - This means “forty days, both
    during the day and during the night.” Make sure the translation
    of this phrase does not sound like a period of eighty days.
-   **tempted him to sin** - Since Jesus did not sin, make sure you use
    a word that does not imply that Satan succeeded in convincing Jesus
    to sin. This phrase could also be translated as, “tried to convince
    him to sin.”

The First Temptation 25-02
============================


**Satan** **tempted** **Jesus** by saying, “If you are the **Son of
God**, **turn these rocks into bread** so you can eat!”

Translation Notes:
------------------

-   **turn these rocks into bread** - This may also be translated as,
    “make these rocks become bread” or, “supernaturally change
    these rocks into bread.”
-   **bread** – This could be translated as, “food” for languages
where
    bread is not a common food. In the Jews' culture, bread was the
    main food.

God's Word Gives Life 25-03
=============================


**Jesus** replied, “It is written in **God’s word,** ‘People do
not only need **bread** in order to live, **but they need every word
that God speaks!**’”

Translation Notes:
------------------

-   **bread** – Make sure that you use the same word to translate
    “bread” here as you did in
-   **but they need every word that God speaks!** - Another way to
    translate this would be, “Rather, people need to listen to and
    obey everything God says” or, “Rather, people have real life by
    believing and obeying what God says.”

The Second Temptation 25-04
=============================


Then **Satan** took **Jesus** to the highest point on the **Temple**
and said, “If you are the **Son of God**, **throw yourself down**,
because **it is written**, ‘**God** will command his **angels** to
carry you **so your foot does not hit a stone**.’”

Translation Notes:
------------------

-   **throw yourself down** - That is, “jump off this building to the
    ground.”
-   **it is written** – That is, “a prophet of God wrote long ago.”
-   **so your foot does not hit a stone** - This means, “so that you
    will not be hurt at all; not even your foot will be injured on a
    stone.” It could also be translated as, “so that even your foot
    will not strike against a stone; you will not be injured at all.”

Do Not Test God 25-05
=======================


But **Jesus** replied to **Satan** by quoting from the **Scriptures.**
He said, “**In God's Word, he commands his people, ‘Do not test the
Lord your God**.’”

Translation Notes:
------------------

-   **In God’s Word, he commands his people, ‘Do not test the Lord,
your
    God.’”** – This could be translated as an indirect quote: “God
    commands us in his Word that we should not test the Lord our God.”
-   **Do not test the Lord your God** - This could be translated as, “Do
    not make the Lord your God prove himself to you” or, “Do not
    make the Lord your God prove that he is good.”
-   **Lord your God** – That is, “Yahweh, your God” or, “Yahweh,
who is
    God and has authority over you.”

The Third Temptation 25-06
============================


Then **Satan** showed **Jesus** all the **kingdoms of the world** and
all **their glory** and said, “**I will give you all this** if you
bow down and **worship** me.”

Translation Notes:
------------------

-   **kingdoms of the world** - This refers to all the greatest cities,
    countries, and other territories of the world.
-   **their glory** - That is, “their power and wealth.” -   **I
will give you all this** - This could be translated as, “I will
    give you all the wealth and power of these kingdoms” or, “I will
    make you the ruler over all these countries, cities and people.”

Worship Only God 25-07
========================


**Jesus** replied, “**Get away from me**, **Satan**!  **In God’s
word he commands his people, ‘Worship only the Lord your God and only
serve him**.’”

Translation Notes:
------------------

-   **Get away from me** - This may also be translated as, “Leave me”
    or, “Leave me alone.”
-   **In God’s word he commands his people, “Worship only the
Lord your
    God and only serve him”** – This could be written as an indirect
    quote, “In God's word, he commands us that we must worship and
    serve only the Lord God, who rules over us.”
-   **Lord your God** – Translate this phrase the same way as you did in
-   **and only serve him** – Another way to say this would be, “He is
    the only one you should serve.”

Angels Ministered to Jesus 25-08
==================================


**Jesus** **did not give in to** **Satan's** **temptations**, so Satan
left him. Then **angels** came and took care of Jesus.

*A Bible story from: Matthew 4:1-11; Mark 1:12-13; Luke 4:1-13*

Translation Notes:
------------------

-   **did not give in to** - This could be translated as, “did not do
    the things that Satan was tempting him to do.”
-   *A Bible story from* - These references may be slightly different in
    some Bible translations.

Jesus in Galilee 26-01
========================


**After overcoming Satan's temptations, Jesus returned** **in the power
of the Holy Spirit** to the region of **Galilee** where he lived. Jesus
**went from place to place teaching**.  **Everyone** **spoke well
of him**.

Translation Notes:
------------------

-   **After overcoming Satan's temptations, Jesus returned** – You may
    prefer to make this into two sentences and say, “Jesus did not do
    the wrong things Satan tried to get him to do and so defeated him.
    After that, Jesus returned.” The word “overcoming” can
    also be translated with “resisting” or, “rejecting” or,
    “refusing.”
-   **in the power of the Holy Spirit** - This may be translated as, “as
    the power of the Holy Spirit worked through him” or, “and the
    Holy Spirit was powerfully guiding him.”
-   **went from place to place teaching** – That is, he “traveled to
    different towns and other places and taught the people there.”
-   **Everyone** - That is, “Everyone who knew him or heard about
him.” -   **spoke well of him** - That is, “said good things about
him.”

Jesus in Nazareth 26-02
=========================


**Jesus** went to the town of **Nazareth** where he had lived during
his childhood. On the **Sabbath**, he went to the **place of worship**
so that he would read from it. They handed him the **scroll of the
prophet Isaiah**. Jesus **opened up the scroll** and read part of it to
the people.

Translation Notes:
------------------

-   **place of worship** – That is, “the building where the Jews
    gathered to worship God.” This can also be translated as, “worship
    building.”
-   **scroll** - A scroll was a long sheet of paper or leather that was
    rolled up and had writing on it.
-   **the scroll of the prophet Isaiah** – That is, “the scroll
that had
    the words that the prophet Isaiah had written.” Isaiah had written
    on a scroll hundreds of years before. This was a copy of that scroll.
-   **opened up the scroll** – This could be translated as, “rolled
open
    the scroll” or, “unrolled the scroll.”

Jesus Read the Scriptures 26-03
=================================


Jesus read, “**God** has given me his **Spirit** so that I can
**proclaim good news to the poor**, **freedom to captives**, **recovery
of sight for the blind**, and **release to the oppressed**. This is
**the year of the Lord's favor**.”

Translation Notes:
------------------

-   **proclaim good news to the poor** - That is, “to tell poor and
    needy people the good message that God will help them.”
-   **freedom to captives** - That is, “to tell people who are
    wrongfully in prison that they will be released.”
-   **recovery of sight for the blind** - This could be translated as,
    “that those who are blind will receive their sight.”
-   **release to the oppressed** - That is, “freedom for those who are
    mistreated in life.”
-   **the year of the Lord's favor** - This may be translated as, “the
    time when the Lord will be merciful to us” or, “the time when
    the Lord will be very gracious to us.”

The Prophesy about Jesus 26-04
================================


Then **Jesus** sat down.  Everybody watched him closely. They knew
the passage of **scripture** that he had just read referred to the
**Messiah**. Jesus said, “**The words I just read to you are happening
right now**.” All the people were **amazed**. “**Isn’t this the
son of Joseph**?” they said.

Translation Notes:
------------------

-   **The words I just read to you are happening right now** - Other
    ways to translate this would be, “The words you just heard me read
    are being fulfilled right now” or, “Today the words I read to
    you came true as you heard them.”
-   **amazed** - Translate the word “amazed” with a term that
means that
    they were surprised, shocked, and confused about how this could
    be possible.
-   **Isn't this the son of Joseph?** –This could also be translated as,
    “This man is only the son of Joseph!” or, “Everyone knows he is
    just Joseph's son!” The people were not asking if he was Joseph's
    son or not. They were wondering how he could be the Messiah since
    they thought he was only the son of an ordinary man.

The Ministry of Elijah 26-05
==============================


Then **Jesus** said, “It is **true** that **no prophet is accepted
in his own hometown**. During the time of the prophet **Elijah**, there
were many widows in **Israel**.  But when it did not rain for three and
a half years, **God** did not send Elijah to help a widow from Israel,
but rather to a widow from a different nation.”

Translation Notes:
------------------

-   **no prophet is accepted in his hometown** - This phrase means,
    “people do not recognize the authority of a prophet that has grown
    up among them.”

The Ministry of Elisha 26-06
==============================


**Jesus** continued saying, “And during the time of the **prophet**
**Elisha**, there were many people in **Israel** with skin diseases. But
Elisha did not **heal** any of them. He only healed the skin disease
of **Naaman**, **a commander** of Israel’s enemies.” The people who
were listening to Jesus were **Jews**. So when they heard him say this,
**they were furious at him**.

Translation Notes:
------------------

-   **Elisha** - Elisha was God's prophet who came after Elijah. Like
    Elijah, Elisha confronted Israelite kings who were sinning against
    God and he did miracles that God gave him power to do.
-   **a commander** – That is, “a military leader.” -   **they
were furious at him** - The Jews did not want to hear that
    God had blessed any people group besides themselves, so they were
    very angry at what Jesus said.

The Attempt to Kill Jesus 26-07
=================================


The people of **Nazareth** dragged **Jesus** out of the **place of
worship** and brought him to the edge of a cliff to throw him off of it
in order to kill him.  **But Jesus walked through the crowd** and left
the town of Nazareth.

Translation Notes:
------------------

-   **place of worship** - That is, “the building where the Jewish
    people gathered to worship God.” This can also be translated as
    “worship building.” See how you translated it in
-   **But Jesus walked through the crowd** - “But” could be translated
    with a strong contrast word or phrase such as “But instead” or,
    “However” to show that the people were not able to do to Jesus
    what they had planned to do.

Jesus Healed the Sick 26-08
=============================


Then **Jesus** **went throughout the region of Galilee**, and large crowds
came to him. They brought many people who were sick or handicapped,
including those who could not see, walk, hear, or speak, and Jesus
**healed** them.

Translation Notes:
------------------

-   **went throughout the region of Galilee** - That is, “all around in
    Galilee” or, “from place to place in Galilee.”

Jesus Removed the Demons 26-09
================================


Many people **who had demons in them** were brought to **Jesus**. **At
Jesus' command**, the **demons** came out of the people, and often
shouted, “You are the **Son of God**!” The crowds of people were
amazed and **worshiped** **God**.

Translation Notes:
------------------

-   **who had demons in them** –That is, “who were controlled by evil
    spirits.”
-   **When Jesus commanded them** - This could also be translated as,
    “When Jesus gave the command to them.”

The Twelve Disciples 26-10
============================


Then **Jesus** chose twelve men **who were called his apostles**. The
apostles traveled with Jesus and **learned from him**.

*A Bible story from: Matthew 4:12-25; Mark 1:14-15, 35-39; 3:13-21;
Luke 4:14-30, 38-44*

Translation Notes:
------------------

-   **learned from him** – That is, “learned from what he taught
them”
    or, “learned from everything he said and did.”
-   *A Bible story from* - These references may be slightly different in
    some Bible translations.

The Lawyer's Question 27-01
=============================


**One day**, an **expert in the Jewish law** came to **Jesus** **to test
him**, saying, “**Teacher**, what must I do **to inherit** **eternal
life**?” Jesus answered, “**What is written in God's law**?”

Translation Notes:
------------------

-   **One day** - This phrase introduces an event that happened in the
    past, but does not state the specific time. Many languages have a
    similar way to begin telling a true story.
-   **expert in the Jewish law** - This man was someone who studied and
    taught the laws God had given the Israelites, as well as other
    Jewish laws.
-   **to test him** - That is, “to see if Jesus would give a good
    answer.”
-   **to inherit eternal life** - That is, “to have life with God
    forever” or, “so that God will give me life with him forever”
    or, “to receive eternal life from God.” The law expert was asking
    how he could be worthy to receive eternal life as an inheritance
    from God the Father.
-   **eternal life** - This refers to life forever with God after the
    mortal body dies. See the key term page for eternal life.
-   **What is written in God's law?** - That is, “What is written in
    God's law about this?” Jesus asked this question because he wanted
    the man to think about what God's law really teaches.

Obey the Commandments 27-02
=============================


The **law expert** replied that **God's law** says, “**Love the Lord
your God** **with all your heart, soul, strength, and mind**. And **love
your neighbor as yourself**.” **Jesus** answered, “You are correct! Do
this and you will **live**.”

Translation Notes:
------------------

-   **law expert** - That is, “an expert in the Jewish law.” See
how you
    translated this term in
-   **Love the Lord your God** – You may choose to say, “We must love
    the Lord our God.” Make sure it does not sound like the man is
    commanding Jesus. Rather, he is quoting what God's law commands
    people to do.
-   **with all your heart, soul, strength, and mind** - That is, “with
    your whole self” or, “with every part of yourself.” In some
    languages this might be translated as, “with all your liver, breath,
    strength, and thoughts.” The focus is not on each of these parts,
    but on all of us. Use the concepts in your language that make up
    the whole person.
-   **heart** - The heart refers to the part of a person that has
    desires and emotions.
-   **soul** - The soul refers to the nonphysical, spiritual part of a
    person.
-   **strength** - Strength refers to the physical body and all of its
    abilities.
-   **mind** - The mind refers to the part of a person that thinks,
    plans, and has ideas.
-   **neighbor** - The word “neighbor” normally refers to a person who
    lives near us. The Jews applied the term to someone who was neither
    a close relative nor a foreigner or enemy.
-   **love your neighbor as yourself** – That is, “love your
neighbor to
    the same extent that you love yourself.”

Who Is My Neighbor? 27-03
===========================


But the **law expert** wanted to prove that he was **righteous**, so he
asked, “**Who is my neighbor?**”

Translation Notes:
------------------

-   **law expert** - That is, “an expert in the Jewish law.” See
how you
    translated this term in
-   **Who is my neighbor?** – This could also be translated as,
“What do
    you mean by 'neighbor'?” or, “Which people are my neighbors?”
    He knew that he did not love everyone, and was asking which people
    he needed to love.

The Jewish Traveler 27-04
===========================


**Jesus** answered the **law expert** by telling a story. “There
was a **Jewish** man who was traveling along the road **from Jerusalem
to Jericho**.”

Translation Notes:
------------------

-   (The cloud-like frame around this picture indicates that Jesus is
    telling a story, and not necessarily explaining a historical event.)
-   **law expert** - See how you translated this term in -   **from
Jerusalem to Jericho** – In some languages you could
    translate this as, “from the city of Jerusalem to the city of
    Jericho” or, “from Jerusalem City to Jericho City.”

The Robbers 27-05
===================


“While the man was traveling, he was attacked by a group of robbers.
They took **everything he had** and beat him until he was almost dead.
Then they went away.”

Translation Notes:
------------------

- -   **everything he had** – That is, “everything he had with him,
    including the clothes he was wearing.”

The Priest 27-06
==================


“Soon after that, a **Jewish** **priest** **happened to walk down**
that same road. When this **religious leader** saw the man who had been
robbed and beaten, he moved to the other side of the road, **ignored
the man** who needed help, and **kept on going**.”

Translation Notes:
------------------

- -   **happened to walk down** – That is, “happened to be traveling
    along.” For some languages it may be necessary to use a word like
    “travel” rather than “walk” since the priest was not just
    walking on the road but was traveling to get to another city.
-   **ignored the man** - That is, “did not help the man” or,
“showed no
    concern for the man.”
-   **kept on going** - That is, “continued traveling down the road.”

The Levite 27-07
==================


“Not long after that, a Levite **came down the road**. (**Levites
were a tribe of Jews** who helped the **priests** at the **Temple The
Levite also crossed over to the other side of the road and **ignored**
the man who had been robbed and beaten.”

Translation Notes:
------------------

- -   **came down the road** – That is, “was traveling down that same
    road.”
-   **Levites were a tribe of Jews** – That is, “Levites were from the
    Israelite tribe of Levi” or, “Levites were from the Israelite
    clan of Levi.”
-   **ignored** – That is, “did not help.”

The Samaritan 27-08
=====================


“The next person to **walk down** that road was a **Samaritan**.
(Samaritans were the descendants of **Jews** who had married people
from other nations. Samaritans and Jews hated each other.) But when the
Samaritan saw the Jewish man, he felt very strong compassion for him. So
he cared for him and bandaged his wounds.”

Translation Notes:
------------------

- -   **walk down** – That is, “travel along.” These people were
traveling
    from one city to another. Make sure that it does not sound like they
    were just taking a walk.

Help for the Victim 27-09
===========================


“The **Samaritan** then lifted the man onto **his own donkey** and
took him to a **roadside inn** **where he took care of him**.”

Translation Notes:
------------------

- -   **his own donkey** – Make sure it is clear that “his” refers
to the
    Samaritan.
-   **roadside inn** – That is, “a lodging place.” This is a
place where
    travelers could get food and stay overnight.
-   **where he took care of him** – This could also be translated as,
    “where he continued to take care of him.”

Generous Help 27-10
=====================


“The next day, the **Samaritan** needed to **continue his journey**. He
gave some money to the person **in charge of** the inn and said,
‘**Take care of him**, and if you spend any more money than this,
I will **repay those expenses** when I return.’”

Translation Notes:
------------------

- -   **continue his journey** – This could be translated as,
“continue
    traveling toward his destination.”
-   **in charge of** – That is, “who managed.” It could be that this
    person also owned this lodging place.
-   **Take care of him** – For some languages it may be preferable to
    say, “Please take care of him” in order for it to be clear that
    this was a polite request, not an order.
-   **repay those expenses** – This could also be translated as,
“repay
    you” or, “repay that money” or, “repay it.”

Do the Same 27-11
===================


Then **Jesus** asked the **law expert**, “What do you think? Which
one of **the three men** **was a neighbor** to the man who was robbed
and beaten?” He replied, “The one who was **merciful** to him.”
Jesus told him, “**You go and do the same**.”

*A Bible story from: Luke 10:25-37*

Translation Notes:
------------------

-   **law expert** - That is, “an expert in the Jewish law.” See
how you
    translated this term in
-   **the three men** - The three men were the priest, the Levite, and
    the Samaritan.
-   **neighbor** - Jesus is using the word “neighbor” in a broader
sense
    than in “Neighbor” here refers to anyone that we meet who needs
    our help.
-   **was a neighbor** - This can also be translated as, “behaved as a
    neighbor” or, “was a friend” or, “acted in a loving way”.
-   **You go and do** – That is, “You, too, should go and do”
or, “Now
    you must do.” Jesus was commanding the law expert to do as the
    Samaritan did.
-   **do the same** – That is, “love others, even your enemies.”
Make
    sure it does not sound like “the same” is only referring to
    helping a wounded man.
-   *A Bible story from* - These references may be slightly different in
    some Bible translations.

What Must I Do? 28-01
=======================


**One day**, a **rich young ruler** **came up to Jesus** and asked him,
“**Good teacher**, what must I do **to have eternal life**?” Jesus
said to him, “**Why do you call me 'good'**? **There is only one who is
good, and that is God**. But if you want to have eternal life, **obey**
**God's laws**.”

Translation Notes:
------------------

-   **One day** - This phrase introduces an event that happened in the
    past, but does not state the specific time. Many languages have a
    similar way to begin telling a true story.
-   **rich young ruler** - This man was already a rich and powerful
    political official, even though he was still young.
-   **came up to Jesus** - That is, “approached Jesus.” -   **Good
teacher** - That is, “righteous teacher.” He was not saying
    that Jesus was simply a skilled teacher.
-   **to have eternal life** - That is, “to receive eternal life” or,
    “to live with God forever.” Also consider how “eternal life”
    was translated on and see the note about that there.
-   **Why do you call me 'good'** - Jesus is not denying that he is God.
    Rather, he is asking if the ruler understands that Jesus is God.
-   **There is only one who is good, and that is God** - Another way to
    say this would be, “The only one who is truly good is God” or,
    “God is the only one who is truly good.”

God's Commandments 28-02
==========================


“**Which ones do I need to obey?**” he asked.  **Jesus** replied,
“Do not murder. Do not commit **adultery**. Do not steal. Do not
lie. Honor your father and mother, and **love** your neighbor **as you
love yourself**.”

Translation Notes:
------------------

-   **Which ones do I need to obey?** - That is, “Which laws will be
    enough for me to receive eternal life?”
-   **as you love yourself** - That is, “as much as you love yourself”
    or, “to the same degree that you love yourself.”

What Else Must I Do? 28-03
============================


But the young man said, “I have **obeyed** all these **laws** **ever
since I was a boy**. **What do I still need to do** in order to live
forever?” **Jesus** looked at him and **loved him**.

Translation Notes:
------------------

-   **ever since I was a boy** – Another way to say this would be,
“from
    the time I was a child until now.”
-   **What do I still need to do?** - That is, “What else do I need to
    do” or, “What do I need to do in addition to these?”
-   **loved him** - Jesus had compassion on him. Choose a word for love
    that is consistent with the kind of love God has for people.

Sell Everything 28-04
=======================


**Jesus** answered, “If **you** want to be **perfect**, then go and
sell **everything you own** and give the money to the poor, and you will
have **treasure in heaven**. Then come and follow me.”

Translation Notes:
------------------

-   **you** - If your language has different words for “you” depending
    on the number of people intended, use the singular form. Jesus was
    addressing this command to this one man.
-   **perfect** - That is, “completely righteous.” -   **everything
you own** - That is, “all of your possessions.” -   **treasure** -
This could also be translated as, “riches” or, “great
    wealth.”
-   **in heaven** - This could also be translated as, “located in heaven
    when you arrive there.” This treasure will exist “there and
    then,” as opposed to the wealth that Jesus asked the young man to
    give up “here and now.”

Not Willing to Obey 28-05
===========================


When the young man **heard what Jesus said**, he became very sad,
because he was very rich and did not want to give away all the things
he possessed. He turned and went away from Jesus.

Translation Notes:
------------------

-   **heard what Jesus said** – That is, “heard Jesus tell him to give
    away what he owned.”

The Camel and the Needle 28-06
================================


Then **Jesus** said to his **disciples**, “It is extremely hard for
rich people to **enter into the kingdom of God**! Yes, it is easier for
a **camel** to go through the **eye of a needle** than for a rich man
to enter the kingdom of God.”

Translation Notes:
------------------

-   **enter the kingdom of God** - This can also be translated as,
    “become a citizen in God's kingdom.”
-   **camel** - Camels are very large animals that are often used to
    carry heavy loads. If camels are not known in your language area,
    a phrase such as, “very large animal” or, “beast of burden”
    could be used. If you choose to substitute the name of some other
    large animal, make sure that the animal would have been known by
    the people Jesus was talking to, such as, “ox” or, “donkey.”
-   **eye of a needle** - This refers to the tiny hole in the end of a
    sewing needle. The idea of something as large as a camel going
    through the eye of a needle is intended to represent something that
    is impossible.

Who Can Be Saved? 28-07
=========================


When the **disciples** heard what Jesus said, they were **shocked**
and said, “Then **who can be saved**?”

Translation Notes:
------------------

-   **shocked** - That is, “greatly astonished.” -   **who can be
saved** - This could also be translated as, “If even
    rich people cannot be saved, how can anyone else be saved?” Many
    people believed that being rich was a sign of God's favor.
-   **saved** - Here it refers to being saved from God's judgment and
    condemnation for sin and being allowed to be a citizen in God's
    kingdom.

All Things Are Possible 28-08
===============================


**Jesus** looked at the **disciples** and said, “**With people this
is impossible**, but **with God, all things are possible**.”

Translation Notes:
------------------

-   **With people this is impossible** - That is, “It is not possible
    for people to do this” or, “Mere humans cannot save themselves.”
-   **with God, all things are possible** - This could also be
    translated as, “God is able to do anything, even save a rich
    person” or, “God is able to do impossible things, so he can save
    even a rich person.”

What Is Our Reward? 28-09
===========================


**Peter** said to **Jesus**, “We have **left everything** and followed
you. **What will be our reward?**”

Translation Notes:
------------------

-   **left everything** - That is, “left everything behind” or,
“given
    up everything we owned.”
-   **What will be our reward?** - Another way to say this is, “What
    reward will we receive” or, “How will we be rewarded?” or,
    “What will God give us as a reward?” It may also be necessary
    to add, “because we have done this?”

The First and the Last 28-10
==============================


**Jesus** answered, “Everyone who **has left** houses, brothers,
sisters, father, mother, children, or property **for my sake**, will
receive **100 times more** and will also receive **eternal life**. But
**many who are first will be last**, and **many who are last will be
first**.”

Translation Notes:
------------------

-   **has left** – That is, “has left behind” or, “has given
up” or,
    “has counted as less important than God.”
-   **for my sake** - This may also be translated as, “because of me”
    or, “on my account.”
-   **100 times more** - That is, “very much more than he had before.”
-   **many who are first will be last** - That is, “many people who are
    important now, will not be important then.”
-   **many who are last will be first** - That is, “many people who are
    considered to not be very important on earth will be considered very
    important in heaven” or, “Many people who are considered now to
    be of little value on earth will be highly valued in heaven.”
-   *A Bible story from* - These references may be slightly different in
    some Bible translations.

How Many Times? 29-01
=======================


**One day**, **Peter** asked **Jesus**, “**Master**, how many times
should I **forgive** **my brother** when he **sins against me**? **Up
to** seven times?” Jesus said, “**Not seven times, but seventy times
seven!**” **By this, Jesus meant** that we should always forgive. Then
Jesus told **this story**.

Translation Notes:
------------------

-   **One day** - This phrase introduces an event that happened in the
    past, but does not state the specific time. Many languages have a
    similar way to begin telling a true story.
-   **my brother** - This term sometimes included people who were not
    actually siblings, but who shared another very strong connection
    such as religion, ethnic background, etc.
-   **sins against me** - This could also be translated as, “does
    something wrong against me.”
-   **Up to** - That is, “as many as.” -   **Not seven times, but
seventy times seven!** - This could be
    translated as, “You should not forgive only seven times, rather you
    should forgive seventy times seven times.” Jesus was not talking
    about an exact number. He was saying that we should forgive people
    every time they sin against us.
-   **By this, Jesus meant** – That is, “When Jesus said this he
meant.” -   **this story** - That is, “the following story.”

The Huge Debt 29-02
=====================


Jesus said, “**The kingdom of God is like** **a king who** wanted to
**settle accounts with his servants**. One of his servants owed a huge
debt worth 200,000 years’ wages.”

Translation Notes:
------------------

-   **The kingdom of God is like** - Another way to say this would be,
    “God's rule over people is like” or, “The way God rules people
    can be compared to.”
-   **is like a king who** - This could be translated as, “is like the
    kingdom of a king who” or, “can be compared with the rule of a
    king who.”
-   **settle accounts with his servants** - That is, “collect the debts
    his servants owed him” or, “collect the money his servants had
    borrowed from him.”

Not Able to Repay 29-03
=========================


“Since the **servant** could not **pay the debt**, the **king** said,
‘Sell this man and his family as **slaves** **to make payment on his
debt**.’”

    owes me.”

The Debt Is Canceled 29-04
============================


“The **servant** **fell on his knees** **before the king** and said,
‘Please be patient with me, and I will pay the full amount that I owe
you.’ The king **felt pity** for the servant, so he **canceled all of
his debt** and let him go.”

Translation Notes:
------------------

- -   **fell on his knees** - That is, “quickly knelt down on the
ground.”
    This was a way to show his humility and his desire for the king to
    help him. Make sure it doesn't sound like he fell down accidentally.
-   **before the king** - This means, “in front of the king.” -
**felt pity** - That is, “felt compassion for” or, “felt sorry
for.”
    The king knew that the servant and his family would suffer greatly
    if they were sold into slavery.
-   **canceled all of his debt** - This can be translated as, “said that
    the servant did not need to pay back any of the money that he owed
    the king.”

The Small Debt 29-05
======================


“But when the **servant** went out from the king, he found a **fellow
servant** who owed him a debt worth four months’ wages. The servant
grabbed his fellow servant and said, ‘Pay me the money that you owe
me!’”

------------------

- -   **fellow servant** - This refers to another man who was also a
    servant of the king.

To Prison 29-06
=================


“The **fellow servant** **fell on his knees** and said, ‘Please be
patient with me, and I will pay the full amount that I owe you.’ But
instead, the servant **threw his fellow servant into prison** until he
could pay the debt.”

Translation Notes:
------------------

- -   **fellow servant** - Translate this phrase in the same way as in
-   **fell on his knees** - This phrase has the same meaning as in -
**threw his fellow servant into prison** - This could also be
    translated as, “had the man put into prison.” The word “threw”
    is figurative and means it was done in a forceful way.

The King Heard 29-07
======================

disturbed**. They went to the **king** and told him **everything**.”

Translation Notes:

The Wicked Servant 29-08
==========================


“The **king** **called the servant** and said, ‘You wicked servant! I
**forgave** your debt because you **begged me**. **You should have done

-   **You should have done the same** - That is, “You should have
    forgiven the man who owed you, just as I forgave you.”
-   **threw** - That is, “commanded his guards to put.” Consider how
    “threw” was translated in frame

Forgive Your Brother 29-09
============================


**Then Jesus said**, “**This** is what **my heavenly Father** will do
to every one of you if you do not **forgive** **your brother** **from
your heart**.”

*A Bible story from: Matthew 18:21-35*

Translation Notes:
------------------

-   **Then Jesus said** – Some languages may add, “to his
disciples.” -   **This** - “This” refers back to the way the king
punished the
    unforgiving servant in
-   **my heavenly Father** - That is, “my Father in heaven.” Jesus is
    expressing his unique, personal relationship to God the Father.

heart** - That is, “with sincerity” or, “truly” or,
    “genuinely” or, “honestly.”

    some Bible translations.

A Quiet Place 30-01
=====================


**Jesus** sent his **apostles** to **preach** and to teach people in
many different villages. When they returned to where Jesus was, they
told him what they had done. Then Jesus invited them to go with him to
a **quiet place** across the lake to rest for a while. So, they got into
a boat and went to the other side of the lake.

Translation Notes:
------------------

-   **returned** - This could also be translated as, “returned to
Jesus”
    or, “returned to where Jesus was.”
-   **quiet place** - This refers to a place with few people where they
    could be by themselves.

The Crowd Followed Jesus 30-02
================================


But there were many people who saw **Jesus** and the **disciples**
**leave in the boat**. These people ran along the shore of the lake to
get to the other side ahead of them. So when Jesus and the disciples
**arrived**, a large group of people was already there, waiting for them.

-   **leave in the boat** - Some languages may need to add, “to cross
    the lake.”

“got
    there.”

Jesus Taught and Healed People 30-03
======================================

children**. **Jesus** felt great compassion towards the people. **To
Jesus**, these people were **like sheep without a shepherd**. So he
taught them and **healed** the people among them who were sick.

Translation Notes:
------------------

-   **not counting the women and children** - That is, “not counting the
    women and children who were with them” or, “and there were
    also women and children in addition to the men.” Another way to
    translate this could also be, “in addition, there were many women
    and children.”
-   **To Jesus** – That is, “Jesus knew that” or, “Jesus
understood
    that.”
-   **like sheep without a shepherd** - This could be translated as,
    “vulnerable and lost, just like sheep are when they have no shepherd
    to take care of them.”

The People Were Hungry 30-04
==============================


**Late in the day**, the **disciples** told **Jesus**, “It is late
and there are no towns nearby. **Send the people away** so they can go
get something to eat.”

Translation Notes:
------------------

-   **Late in the day** - This could also be translated as, “When it was
    almost evening.”
-   **Send the people away** - This could be translated as, “Please tell
    the people to go to a town” or, “Shouldn't you tell the people
    to go somewhere?” or, “Let the people go to a town.” Make sure
    it sounds like a polite request, not an order.

Five Loaves and Two Fish 30-05
================================


But **Jesus** said to the **disciples**, “You give them something to
eat!” They responded, “**How can we do that?** We only have five
loaves of bread and two small fish.”

Translation Notes:
------------------

-   **How can we do that?** – This could be translated as, “We
cannot do
    that!” or, “It is impossible to do that!” The disciples were
    not asking an actual question. Rather, they were strongly expressing
    that they did not think this was possible.

Preparation for the Meal 30-06
================================


**Jesus** told his **disciples** to tell the people in the crowd to sit
down on the grass, in groups of fifty people each.

Translation Notes:
------------------

-   **

Jesus Blessed the Food 30-07
==============================


Then **Jesus** took the five loaves of bread and the two fish, looked
up to **heaven**, and thanked **God** for the food.

Translation Notes:
------------------

-   **

Everyone Ate 30-08
====================


Then **Jesus** **broke the bread and the fish** into pieces. He gave the
pieces to his **disciples** to give to the people. The disciples kept
passing out the food, and **it never ran out**! All the people ate and
**were satisfied**.

Translation Notes:
------------------

-   **broke the bread and the fish** - That is, “tore the bread and the
    fish.”
-   **it never ran out** – Another way to say this would be, “there
was
    always more left.”
-   **were satisfied** – That is, “were no longer hungry” or,
“were not
    hungry any more.”

More than Enough 30-09
========================


After that, the **disciples** collected the food that had not been eaten
and it was enough to fill twelve baskets! All the food came from the
five loaves of bread and two fish.

*A Bible story from: Matthew 14:13-21; Mark 6:31-44; Luke 9:10-17;
John 6:5-15*

Translation Notes:
------------------

-   *A Bible story from* - These references may be slightly different in
    some Bible translations.

Jesus Prayed Alone 31-01
==========================


Then **Jesus** told the **disciples** to get into the boat and sail to the
other side of the lake while **he dismissed the crowd**. After Jesus had
sent the crowd away, he went up on a **mountainside** to **pray**. Jesus
was there all alone, and he prayed until late at night.

Translation Notes:
------------------

-   **he dismissed the crowd** - This is another way of saying, “he sent
    the crowd on their way” or, “he told the crowd of people to go
    back to their homes.”
-   **mountainside** - That is, “the side of a mountain.”

The Storm 31-02
=================


**Meanwhile**, the **disciples** were **rowing their boat**, but by
late in the night they had only **reached** the middle of the lake. They
were rowing with **great difficulty** because the wind was blowing hard
against them.

Translation Notes:
------------------

-   **Meanwhile** - That is, “while Jesus was praying on the
    mountainside.”
-   **rowing their boat** - The boat had a sail, but it would not have
    worked when the wind was against them.
-   **reached** - This can also be translated as, “traveled as far
as.” -   **great difficulty** - That is, “much difficulty” or,
“a lot of
    difficulty.”

Jesus Walked on the Water 31-03
=================================


Then **Jesus** finished praying and went to the disciples. He walked on
top of the water across the lake toward their boat!

Translation Notes:
------------------

-   **

The Disciples Were Afraid 31-04
=================================


The **disciples** were very afraid when they saw **Jesus**, because they
thought they were seeing **a ghost**. Jesus knew that they were afraid, so
he called out to them and said, “**Do not be afraid**. **It is I!**”

Translation Notes:
------------------

-   **a ghost** - That is, “a spirit.” They thought Jesus was
a spirit,
    since normally a human being cannot walk on water.
-   **Do not be afraid** – For some languages it may be more natural to
    say here, “Stop being afraid.”
-   **it is I!** - For some, it might be more natural to translate this
    as, “It is me, Jesus.”

Jesus Called Peter 31-05
==========================


Then **Peter** said to **Jesus**, “**Master**, **if it is you**, command
me to come to you on the water.” Jesus told Peter, “**Come!**”

Translation Notes:
------------------

-   **if it is you** - That is, “if it is really you, and not a
ghost.” -   **Come!** - That is, “Come here” or, “Come to me”
or, “Come, walk to
    me.”

Peter Walked on the Water 31-06
=================================


So, **Peter** got out of the boat and started walking to **Jesus**
on the surface of the water. But after walking a short distance, he
**turned his eyes away from** Jesus and began to look at the waves and
to feel the strong wind.

Translation Notes:
------------------

-   **turned his eyes away from** - This expression means, “looked away
    from.” It could also be translated as, “stopped looking at.”

Peter Sank 31-07
==================


Then **Peter** became afraid and began to sink in the water. He cried
out, “**Master** , **save** me!” **Jesus** reached out right away
and grabbed him. Then he said to Peter, “**You man of little faith**,
**why did you doubt**?”

Translation Notes:
------------------

-   **You man of little faith** - This may also be translated as, “You
    have so little faith in me!” or, “You do not trust me very
    much!”
-   **why did you doubt?** - That is, “You should not have doubted
me!”
    or, “You should have trusted me completely.” This isn't a real
    question, but a way in this language to make a strong point. In many
    languages, it works better to express this as a statement.

The Son of God 31-08
======================


**When Peter and Jesus got into the boat, the wind** immediately stopped
blowing and the water became calm. The **disciples** were amazed. They
**worshiped** Jesus, saying to him, “**Truly, you are the Son of
God**.”

*A Bible story from: Matthew 14:22-33; Mark 6:45-52; John 6:16-21*

Translation Notes:
------------------

-   **When Peter and Jesus got into the boat, the wind** – It may be
    better to say, “Peter and Jesus got into the boat, and then the
    wind.”
-   **worshiped Jesus** – This could be translated as, “bowed down and
    worshiped Jesus.” This word has the idea of physically bowing down
    in front of someone out of respect and reverence.
-   **Truly you are the Son of God** – Other ways to say this would be,
    “You really are the Son of God” or, “It really is true that
    you are the Son of God.”
-   *A Bible story from* - These references may be slightly different in
    some Bible translations.

The Country of the Gerasenes 32-01
====================================


**One day**, **Jesus** and his **disciples** went in a boat across the
lake to the region where **the Gerasene people** lived.

Translation Notes:
------------------

-   **One day** - This phrase introduces an event that happened in the
    past, but does not state the specific time. Many languages have a
    similar way to begin telling a true story.
-   **the Gerasene people** - The Gerasenes lived in an area along the
    eastern shore of the Sea of Galilee. They are descendants of the Jews,
    but we know few details about them.

A Man with Evil Spirits 32-02
===============================


When they reached the other side of the lake, **a demon-possessed man**
**came running up to** **Jesus**.

Translation Notes:
------------------

-   **a demon-possessed man** - That is, “a man who had demons in him”
    or, “a man who was controlled by evil spirits.”
-   **came running up to** - That is, “ran to” or, “ran and
stopped in
    front of.”

Breaking the Chains 32-03
===========================


This man was so strong that nobody could control him. People had even
**fastened** his arms and legs with chains, but he **kept breaking them**.

Translation Notes:
------------------

-   **fastened his arms and legs** - That is, “restrained” or,
“bound.” -   **kept breaking them** - Some languages may need to
say, “kept
    breaking the chains.”

Living among the Tombs 32-04
==============================


The man lived **among the tombs** in the area. This man would scream all
day and all night. He did not wear clothes and cut himself repeatedly
with stones.

Translation Notes:
------------------

-   **among the tombs** - That is “near the tombs” or, “around the
    tombs.”

Jesus Commanded the Demons 32-05
==================================


When the man came to **Jesus**, he **fell on his knees** in front of
him. Jesus said to the **demon**, “Come out of this man!”

Translation Notes:
------------------

-   **fell on his knees** - That is, “quickly knelt down on the
ground.”

My Name Is Legion 32-06
=========================


The **man with the demon** **cried out** in a loud voice, “**What do you
want with me**, **Jesus**, **Son** of **the Most High God**? Please do
not torture me!” Then Jesus asked the demon, “What is your name?”
**He replied**, “My name is **Legion**, because **we are many**.” (A
“legion” was a group of several thousand soldiers in the Roman army.)

Translation Notes:
------------------

-   **cried out** – That is, “shouted” or, “exclaimed.” -
**What do you want with me** - This expression means, “What are you
    going to do to me?”
-   **the Most High God** - That is, “the Supreme God” or, “the Most
    Sovereign God” or, “the Most Powerful God.” The meaning of
    “high” here refers to God's greatness. It does not refer to
    altitude or being tall.
-   **Legion** - This was the name of the group of demons, but it also
    describes that the evil spirits were very numerous. Use the name if
    the note that follows will make the meaning clear in your language.
    If not, you may need to translate the word as something like,
    “Army” or, “Crowd” or, “Thousands.”
-   **we are many** - we are many - That is, “there are many of
us” or,
    “we are many demons.”

The Herd of Pigs 32-07
========================


The **demons** **begged** **Jesus**, “Please **do not send us**
out of this region!” There was a herd of pigs feeding on a nearby
hill. So, the demons begged Jesus, “**Please send us** into the pigs
**instead**!” Jesus said, “**Go!**”

Translation Notes:
------------------

-   **do not send us** – That is, “do not make us go.” -   **Please
send us** – That is, “Please let us go.” -   **instead** - That
is, “instead of making us go away.” -   **Go!** – This could be
translated as, “Go into the pigs!” or, “You
    may go into the pigs!”

The Pigs Drowned 32-08
========================


The **demons** came out of the man and entered the pigs. The pigs ran
down a steep bank into the lake and drowned. There were about 2,000 pigs
in the **herd**.

Translation Notes:
------------------

-   **herd** - That is, “herd of pigs” or, “group of pigs.” Many
    languages have specific names for groups of animals, such as “flock
    of sheep,” “herd of cattle,” “pack of dogs,” and “school
    of fish.” Use a word that can appropriately be used for a large
    group of pigs.

The Man Was Healed 32-09
==========================


When the people who took care of the pigs saw **what happened**, they
ran into the town and told everyone that they met what **Jesus** had
done. The people from the town came and saw the man **who used to have
the demons**. He was sitting calmly, wearing clothes, and acting like
a normal person.

Translation Notes:
------------------

-   **what happened** - That is, “how Jesus sent the demons out of the
    man and into the pigs.”
-   **who used to have the demons** – That is, “in whom the demons had
    lived” or, “who had been controlled by the evil spirits.”

Jesus Left 32-10
==================


The **people** were very **afraid** and asked **Jesus** to leave. So
Jesus got into the boat and **prepared** to leave. The man who used to
have the demons **begged to go along with Jesus**.

Translation Notes:
------------------

-   **people** – Some languages may prefer to say, “people from that
    region” or, “the Gerasene people.”
-   **afraid** – It may be better to say, “afraid because of what
Jesus
    had done.”
-   **prepared** – That is, “was getting ready.” -   **begged to
go along with Jesus** - That is, “begged Jesus to let
    him go with him” or, “earnestly asked Jesus if he could go
    with him.”

Go Home 32-11
===============


But **Jesus** said to him, “No, I want you to go home and tell your
friends and family about everything that **God** has done for you and
**how he has had mercy on you**.”

Translation Notes:
------------------

-   **how he has had mercy on you** - This can be translated as, “how he
    has shown mercy to you” or, “that he has been merciful to you.”

The Testimony of the Man 32-12
================================


So the man went away and told everyone about what **Jesus** had done
for him.  Everyone who **heard his story** **was filled with wonder
and amazement**.

Translation Notes:
------------------

-   **heard his story** – That is, “heard the man tell what had
happened
    to him.”
-   **was filled with wonder and amazement** - The words “amazement”
and
    “wonder” are similar in meaning. They are used together to
    emphasize how amazed the people were. This could be translated as,
    “completely astonished about what he told them.”

The Sick Woman 32-13
======================


**Jesus** returned to the other side of the lake. After he arrived there,
a large crowd gathered around him and **pressed in on him**. In the
crowd was a woman who had suffered from a bleeding problem for twelve
years. She had paid all of her money to doctors so they would **heal**
her, but **she only got worse**.

Translation Notes:
------------------

-   **pressed in on him** - That is, “pushed tightly against him” or,
    “crowded in tightly around him.”
-   **she only got worse** - That is, “her condition only got
worse” or,
    ” her health got worse instead of better” or, “instead she
    became more sick.”

The Woman Was Healed 32-14
============================


She had heard that **Jesus** had **healed** many sick people and thought,
“**I'm sure that if I can just touch Jesus’ clothes, then I will be
healed, too!**” So she came up behind Jesus and touched his clothes. As
soon as she touched them, the bleeding stopped!

Translation Notes:
------------------

-   **

Who Touched Me? 32-15
=======================


Immediately, **Jesus** realized that **power had gone out from him**. So
he turned around and asked, “Who touched me?” The **disciples**
replied, “There are many people crowding around you and bumping into
you. **Why did you ask, ‘Who touched me?’**”

Translation Notes:
------------------

-   **power had gone out from him** - This may be translated as,
    “healing power had flowed from him into someone else” or, “his
    power had healed someone.” Jesus did not lose any power because
    of this.
-   **Why did you ask, ‘Who touched me?’** - In some languages it
may be
    better to use an indirect quote here such as, “Why did you ask who
    was touching you?” or, “Why you are wondering who touched you?”

Healed by Faith 32-16
=======================


The woman **fell on her knees** **before Jesus**, **shaking and very
afraid**. Then she told him what she had done, and that she had been
healed. Jesus said to her, “**Your faith has healed you**. Go in
**peace**.”

*A Bible story from: Matthew 8:28-34; 9:20-22; Mark 5:1-20; 5:24b-34;
Luke 8:26-39; 8:42b-48*

Translation Notes:
------------------

-   **fell on her knees** – That is, “quickly knelt down.” -
**before Jesus** – That is, “in front of Jesus.” -   **shaking
and very afraid** - That is, “shaking with fear” or,
    “trembling because she was afraid.”
-   **Your faith has healed you.** - This could also be translated as,
    “You have been healed because of your faith.”
-   **Go in peace.** - People spoke this traditional blessing when they
    left each other. Other languages may say something similar such as,
    “Go well”, “Go with God” or, “Peace.” Other ways of
    translating it could be, “May you have peace as you go” or,
    “Go and know that all is well between us.”
-   *A Bible story from* - These references may be slightly different in
    some Bible translations.

Jesus Taught the Crowds 33-01
===============================


**One day**, **Jesus** was teaching a very large crowd of people near
the shore of the lake. So many people came to hear him that Jesus got
into a boat at the edge of the water in order to have enough space to
speak to them. He sat in the boat and taught the people.

Translation Notes:
------------------

-   **One day** - This phrase introduces an event that happened in the
    past, but does not state the specific time. Many languages have a

The Seed on the Path 33-02
============================


**Jesus** told this story.  “A farmer went out to plant **some
seed**. As he was **spreading the seeds by hand**, some seeds happened
to fall on the path, and the birds came and ate all of those seeds.”

Translation Notes:
------------------

-   **spreading the seeds by hand** - That is, “throwing the seeds on
    the soil” or, “covering all of his crop soil with seeds.” This
    is the way that farmers in the ancient Middle East typically planted
    grain-bearing crops.

The Seed on the Rocks 33-03
=============================


“Other seeds fell on **rocky ground**, where there was very little soil.
The seeds in the rocky ground sprouted quickly, but their roots were
not able to go deep into the soil. When the sun came up and it got hot,
the plants withered and died.”

Translation Notes:
------------------

- -   **rocky ground** - That is, “ground that was full of rocks.”

The Seed in the Thorns 33-04
==============================


“Still other seeds fell among thorn bushes. Those seeds began to grow,
but **the thorns** **choked them out**. So the plants that grew from
the seeds in the **thorny ground** did not produce any grain.”

Translation Notes:
------------------

- -   **the thorns** – That is, “the thorn plants” or, “the
thorn bushes.” -   **choked them out** - This can also be translated
as, “overshadowed
    them” or, “crowded them out.”

    bushes.”

The Seed in Good Soil 33-05

planted. **He who has ears, let him hear!**”

Translation Notes:
------------------

- -   **good soil** – That is, “fertile soil” or, “soil that
was good for
    growing plants.”

    who hears what I am saying should listen to me carefully” or,
    “If anyone hears what I have said, he should pay attention to what
    I mean.” This can also be translated as a command. “Since you
    have ears to hear, listen carefully to what I am saying.”

The Seed Is the Word 33-06
============================


**This story confused the disciples**. So **Jesus** explained, “The
seed is the **word of God**. The path **is a person** who hears God’s
word, but does not understand it, and the **devil** **takes the word
away from him**.”

Translation Notes:
------------------

-   **This story confused the disciples.** - That is, “The disciples did
    not understand this story.”
-   **is a person** - This comparison can also be translated as, “is
    like a person” or, “represents a person” or, “refers to a
    person” or, “is speaking about a person.”
-   **takes the word away from him** - This may also be translated as,
    “takes God's word away, causing him to forget it” or, “steals
    the word from his heart so he won't believe it and be saved.” You
    may also add the following: “just as birds eat up the seeds that
    fall on a path.”

Persecution and Hardship 33-07
================================


“The **rocky ground** **is a person** who hears **God’s word**
and **accepts it with joy**. But when he experiences hardship or
**persecution**, he **falls away**.”

------------------

- -   **rocky ground** - See how you translated this term in -   **is
a person** - See how you translated this comparison in -   **accepts it

=============================


“The **thorny ground** **is a person** who hears **God’s word**,
but as time passes, the **cares**, **riches**, and **pleasures of life**
**choke out** his **love** for **God**. As a result, the teaching he
heard **does not produce fruit**.”

Translation Notes:
------------------

- -   **thorny ground** - See how you translated this term in -   **is a
person** - See how you translated this comparison in -   **cares** - That

    fruit” or “does not behave in a way that shows God's Spirit is

a person** - See how you translated this comparison in -   **produce
fruit** - See how you translated this phrase in -   *A Bible story from*
- These references may be slightly different in
    some Bible translations.

The Mustard Seed 34-01
========================


**Jesus** told many other **stories** about the **kingdom of God**. For
example, he said, “The kingdom of God is like a **mustard seed** that
someone planted in his field. You know that the mustard seed is **the
smallest seed of all**.”

Translation Notes:
------------------

-   **stories** - Jesus used these stories to teach truths about God's
    kingdom. It is not clear if the events actually happened or not. If
    your language has a term that includes both fictional and real
    stories, you should use it here.
-   **mustard seed** - This probably refers to the seed of the black
    mustard plant, which has tiny seeds that rapidly grow into very
    large plants. If there is a word for this plant in your language,
    you should use it. If not, you may need to substitute the name of
    another plant which has the same characteristics.
-   **the smallest seed of all** - That is, “the smallest of all the
    seeds that people plant.”

The Large Tree 34-02
======================


“But when the **mustard seed** **grows**, it becomes the largest of
all of the **garden plants**, big enough that even the birds come and
**rest in** its branches.”

Translation Notes:
------------------

- -   **mustard seed** - See how you translated this term in -   **grows**
– You may want to add, “into a mature plant.” -   **garden plants**
– This can also be translated as, “plants that
    would be planted in a garden.”
-   **rest in** - This may also be translated as, “sit on” or,
“perch
    on.”

The Yeast 34-03
=================


**Jesus** told another **story**, “The **kingdom of God** is like
**yeast** that a woman mixes into some **bread dough** until **it spreads
throughout the dough**.”

Translation Notes:
------------------

-   **story** - See how you translated this term in -   **yeast** -
This can also be translated as, “leaven” or, “the little
    bit of leaven.” It is added to bread dough to make it rise. A
    little bit of yeast can be mixed into a large amount of dough and
    make the whole batch of dough rise.
-   **bread dough** - This is a mixture of flour and liquid that can be
    shaped and baked into bread. If you do not have words for dough
    or flour, you can borrow a word for flour or call it “ground-up
    grain.”
-   **it spreads throughout the dough** - That is, “every part of the
    dough has yeast in it” or, “the yeast grows throughout all
    the dough.”

The Treasure in the Field 34-04
=================================


“The **kingdom of God** is also like **treasure** that someone hid in
a field. Another man found the treasure and then **buried it again**. He
was so **filled with joy** that he went and sold everything he had and
used the money to **buy that field**.”

Translation Notes:
------------------

- -   **treasure** - That is, “something that is very valuable.” -
**buried it again** - It is also possible to add, “so that no one
    else would find it.”

    “excited.”
-   **buy that field** - Some people may want to add, “so that the
    treasure would be his.”

The Perfect Pearl 34-05
=========================


“The **kingdom of God** is also like a **perfect pearl of great
value**. When a **pearl merchant** found it, he sold all that he had
and used the money to buy it.”

Translation Notes:
------------------

- -   **perfect pearl** – That is, “a pearl without any defects.” -
**pearl** - If pearls are unknown, this can be translated as,
    “beautiful stone” or, “beautiful stone-like thing.”
-   **of great value** – That is, “that was very valuable” or,
“that was
    worth a lot of money.”
-   **pearl merchant** - That is, “pearl dealer” or, “pearl
trader.”
    This refers to a person whose business is buying and selling pearls.

Two Men at the Temple 34-06
=============================


Then **Jesus** told a **story** to some people who **trusted in their
own good deeds** and **despised other people**. He said, “Two men
went to the **Temple** to **pray**. One of them was a **tax collector**,
and the other was a **religious leader**.”

Translation Notes:
------------------

-   **story** - See how you translated this term in -   **trusted in
their own good deeds** - That is, “believed that their
    good deeds made them righteous” or, “were proud of how perfectly
    they kept God's law” or, “believed that their good deeds caused
    God to be completely pleased with them.”
-   **despised other people** - That is, “considered other people to be
    inferior to them” or, “looked down on other people.”

The Religious Leader's Prayer 34-07
=====================================


“**The religious leader prayed like this**, ‘Thank you, **God**,
that **I am not a sinner like** other men—such as robbers, **unjust
men**, **adulterers**, or even like that **tax collector**.’”

Translation Notes:
------------------

- -   **The religious leader prayed like this** - Another way to say this
    would be, “This is how the religious leader prayed” or, “The
    religious leader prayed in this way.”
-   **I am not a sinner like** - That is, “I am not sinful like”
or, “I
    am righteous, not like.”
-   **unjust men** - That is, “men who are not righteous” or,
“people
    who do evil things” or, “law breakers.”

I Am Good 34-08
=================


“‘For example, **I fast** two times every week and I give you **ten
percent** of all the money and goods that I receive.’”

Translation Notes:
------------------

- -   **I fast** - The religious ruler believed that doing this would earn
    favor with God.
-   **ten percent** - That is, “one-tenth.”

The Tax Collector's Prayer 34-09
==================================


“But the **tax collector** **stood far away** from the **religious
leader**, and **did not even look up to heaven**. Instead, **he pounded
on his chest with his fist** and **prayed**, ‘**God**, please be
**merciful** to me because I am a **sinner**.’”

Translation Notes:
------------------

- -   **stood far away** - This can also be translated as, “stood at a
    distance” or, “stayed separate.”
-   **did not even look up to heaven** - The word “even” indicates
that
    people normally looked up to heaven when praying to God, but that
    this man did not because he was so ashamed of his sin.
-   **he pounded on his chest with his fist** - This could also be
    translated as, “because of his grief, he hit his chest with his
    fist” or, “he pounded his chest in sorrow.” If people would
    find this hard to understand because they beat their chest for other
    reasons, you could translate this as, “he showed his despair.”

The Proud Will Be Humbled 34-10
=================================


Then **Jesus** said, “I tell you the **truth**, **God** heard the **tax
collector's** **prayer** and **declared him to be righteous**.  But he did
not like the **religious leader's** prayer. God **will humble** everyone
who is **proud**, and he will lift up whoever **humbles himself**.”

*A Bible story from: Matthew 13:31-33, 44-46; Mark 4:30-32; Luke 13:18-21;
18:9-14*

Translation Notes:
------------------

-   **declared him to be righteous** - That is, “considered him to be a
    righteous person.” Even though the tax collector was a sinner,
    God was merciful to him because of his humility and repentance.
-   **will humble** - This could also be translated as, “will give a
    lower status to” or, “will cause to not be important.” It
    could be translated figuratively as, “will bring down.”
-   **will lift up** - That is, “will give a higher position to” or,
    “will honor.”
-   **humbles himself** - That is, “chooses to behave in a humble way”
    or, “has a humble attitude about himself.”
-   *A Bible story from* - These references may be slightly different in
    some Bible translations.

Jesus Taught Sinners 35-01
============================


**One day**, **Jesus** was teaching many **tax collectors** and other
**sinners** who had gathered to hear him.

Translation Notes:
------------------

-   **One day** - This phrase introduces an event that happened in the
    past, but does not state the specific time. Many languages have a
    similar way to begin telling a true story.
-   **tax collectors** – Tax collectors were considered to be the worst
    of sinners because often they stole money from people by collecting
    a higher tax than the government required.

The Religious Leaders Grumbled 35-02
======================================


Some **religious leaders** who were also there saw **Jesus** treating
these **sinners** as friends, and they began to criticize him to each
other. So Jesus told them this **story**.

Translation Notes:
------------------

-   **story** - Jesus used this story to teach truths about God's
    kingdom. It is not clear if the events actually happened or not. If
    your language has a term that includes both fictional and real
    stories, you should use it here.

The Two Sons 35-03
====================


“There was a man who had two **sons**. The younger son told his father,
‘Father, I want **my inheritance** now!’ So the father divided his
**property** between his two sons.”

Translation Notes:
------------------

- -   **my inheritance** – This could be translated as, “the part
of your
    wealth that will be rightfully mine when you die.”
-   **property** – That is, “wealth” or, “possessions.” This
property
    would probably have included land, animals, and money.

The Younger Son 35-04
=======================


“Soon the younger son gathered all that he had and went far away and
**wasted his money** in **sinful living**.”

Translation Notes:
------------------

- -   **wasted his money** - That is, “spent all his money without
getting
    anything of value in exchange.” In some languages it can be
    translated as, “threw his money away” or, “ate all his money.”
-   **sinful living** - That is, “doing sinful things.”

The Famine 35-05
==================


“After that, **a severe famine happened** in the land where the younger
son was, and he had **no money to buy food**. So he took the only job
he could find, **feeding pigs**. He was so miserable and hungry that he
wanted to eat the pigs’ food.”

Translation Notes:
------------------

- -   **a severe famine happened** - That is, “there was very little
    food.” In some languages this might be translated as, “there
    was a severe famine.”
-   **no money to buy food** - Because of the famine, food was very
    expensive, and he had already spent all of his money.
-   **job** - This refers to work that he would do for someone else in
    exchange for money. If this is not clear, this sentence could start
    with, “So in order to earn some money, he took the only job.”
-   **feeding pigs** - That is, “giving food to pigs.” This would have
    been considered as one of the lowest jobs in society at this time.
    If your language has a certain word for low status jobs, use that
    word.

The Son Repented 35-06
========================


“Finally, the younger son said to himself, ‘**What am I doing?**
All my father’s **servants** have plenty to eat, and yet here I
am starving. I will go back to my father and ask to be one of his
servants.’”

Translation Notes:
------------------

- -   **What am I doing?** - That is, “Why am I living like this?”
or, ” I
    should not be living like this!” or, “It doesn't make sense for
    me to live like this.” The son isn't really asking a question,
    so some languages will have to translate this as a statement.

The Father's Welcome 35-07
============================


“So the younger **son** started back towards his father's home. When
he was **still far away**, his father saw him and **felt compassion**
for him. He ran to his son and hugged him and kissed him.”

Translation Notes:
------------------

- -   **still far away** – This can also be translated as, “within
sight
    of his father's home, but still a distance away.” The son was
    getting close to his father's house but was still far enough away
    that most people in the house would not have seen him. Make sure it
    does not sound like he was still in a different country.
-   **felt compassion** - That is, “felt deep love and pity.”

I Have Sinned 35-08
=====================


“The **son** said, ‘Father, I have **sinned against God and against
you**. **I am not worthy** to be your son.’”

Translation Notes:
------------------

- -   **sinned against God and against you** - This could be translated
    as, “sinned against God, and I have also sinned against you.”
-   **I am not worthy** – It is also possible to say, “So I am not
    worthy” or, “As a result, I am not worthy.”

Prepare the Feast 35-09
=========================


“But his father told one of his **servants**, ‘Go quickly and bring
the best clothes and put them on my **son**! Put a ring on his finger
and put sandals on his feet. Then kill **the best calf** so we can have
a feast and celebrate, because **my son was dead, but now he is alive!**
**He was lost, but now he is found!**’”

Translation Notes:
------------------

- -   **the best calf** – This could also be translated as, “the
fattest
    calf.” This was the calf that had been fattened so that when cooked
    it would taste the best.
-   **My son was dead, but now he is alive!** - That is, “This is like
    my son was dead and is alive again!” or, “I grieved as if my son
    had died, but now I rejoice because it is as if he has come back to
    life!” The father is using this expression to show how happy he
    is that his son has come home.
-   **He was lost, but now he is is found!** - That is, “This is like I
    had lost him but now I have found him.” This expression also shows
    how happy the father is about having his son at home again.

The Older Brother 35-10
=========================


“So the people began to celebrate. **Before long**, the older son
came home from working in the field. He heard the music and dancing and
wondered what was happening.”

Translation Notes:
------------------

- -   **Before long** - This can also be translated as, “Soon” or,
“After
    a little while.”

The Brother Is Angry 35-11
============================


“When the older **son** found out that they were celebrating because
his brother had come home, he was very angry and would not go into the
house. His father came out and **begged** him to come and celebrate with
them, but he refused.”

Translation Notes:
------------------

-

Working for Nothing 35-12
===========================


“The older son said to his father, ‘All these years I have worked
**faithfully** for you! I never **disobeyed** you, and still you did not
even give me **one small goat** so I could celebrate with my friends. But
when **this son of yours** who **consumed your money** in **sinful**
behavior came home, you **killed the best calf** for him!’”

Translation Notes:
------------------

- -   **one small goat** - A small goat would have fed fewer people than
    the best calf, and would not be valued as much. The older brother
    is complaining that his father was treating the sinful younger son
    better than him.
-   **this son of yours** - This expression shows that the older son was
    angry. It shows his rejection of his younger brother and his
    disapproval of his father for welcoming back this wayward son. Other
    languages may also have an indirect way of communicating these things.
-   **consumed your money** - That is, “squandered the money that you
    gave him” or, “devoured your wealth.” If possible, use an
    expression that shows the brother's anger.
-   **killed the best calf** - That is, “killed the best calf to eat at
    a feast.”

We Must Celebrate 35-13
=========================


“The father answered, ‘My **son**, you are always with me, and
everything I have is yours. But **it is right for us** to celebrate,
because **your brother was dead, but now is alive**. **He was lost,
but now is found!**’”

*A Bible story from: Luke 15:11-32*

Translation Notes:
------------------

- -   **it is right for us** - That is, “it is the right thing for us to
    do” or, “it is proper for us.”
-   **your brother** - The father refers to his younger son as, “your
    brother” to remind the older son of his relationship to the younger
    son and of how he should love his younger brother.
-   **was dead, but now is alive** - See how you translated this in -
**He was lost, but now is found!** - See how you translated this in -
*A Bible story from* - These references may be slightly different in
    some Bible translations.

To the Mountain 36-01
=======================


**One day**, **Jesus** took three of his **disciples**, **Peter**,
**James**, and **John** with him. (The disciple named John was not the
same person who **baptized They went up on a high mountain by themselves
to pray.

Translation Notes:
------------------

-   **One day** - This phrase introduces an event that happened in the
    past, but does not state the specific time. Many languages have a
    similar way to begin telling a true story.
-   **James** - This is a different James than the one who wrote the
    Book of James in the Bible. To make this clear, some languages may
    need to use two slightly different names or to spell them differently.

Jesus Was Changed 36-02
=========================


As **Jesus** was praying, his face became as bright as the sun and his
clothes became as white as light, **whiter** than anyone on earth could
make them.

Translation Notes:
------------------

-   **whiter** - That is, “more white.”

Moses and Elijah 36-03
========================


Then **Moses** and the prophet **Elijah** **appeared**. These men had
lived on the earth hundreds of years before this. They talked with
**Jesus** about **his death, which would soon happen** **in Jerusalem**.

Translation Notes:
------------------

-   **appeared** – It is also possible to say, “appeared out of
    nowhere.” They suddenly were there.
-   **his death, which would soon happen** - This could be translated
    as, “how he would soon die” or, “how he would soon be killed.”
-   **in Jerusalem** – Some languages may prefer to say, “in the
city of
    Jerusalem.”

Peter's Comments 36-04
========================


As **Moses** and **Elijah** were talking with **Jesus**, **Peter**
said to Jesus, “It is **good** for us to be here.  Let us make three
**shelters**, one for you, one for Moses, and one for Elijah.” Peter
**did not know what he was saying**.

Translation Notes:
------------------

-   **shelters** - This can also be translated as, “lean-tos” or,
    “garden huts” or, “tents.” It refers to small, individual,
    temporary shelters, like the Jews made from tree branches during an
    annual Jewish holiday.
-   **did not know what he was saying** - That is, “was speaking without
    understanding what was happening” or, “spoke without thinking
    clearly because he was so excited.”

This Is My Son 36-05
======================


As **Peter** was talking, a bright cloud came down and surrounded them and
**a voice from the cloud said**, “This is my **Son** whom I **love**. I
am pleased with him. **Listen to him**.” The three **disciples**
were **terrified** and **fell on the ground**.

Translation Notes:
------------------

-   **a voice from the cloud said** – This can also be translated
as, “a
    voice spoke from the cloud saying” or, “God spoke from the cloud
    and said.”
-   **Listen to him** – This could be translated as, “He is the
one you
    must listen to.”
-   **terrified**–That is, “extremely scared.” -   **fell on the
ground** – That is, “quickly bowed to the ground” or,
    “immediately got down on the ground.” Make sure the translation
    of “fell” does not sound like an accident. They probably did
    this intentionally out of awe and fear.

Alone with Jesus 36-06
========================


Then **Jesus touched them** and said, “**Do not be afraid**. **Get
up**.” When they looked around, **the only one still there was Jesus**.

Translation Notes:
------------------

-   **touched them** – That is, “put his hand on them.” Some
languages
    may prefer to specify where he touched them. If so, this could be
    translated as, “he touched them on the shoulder” or, “he put
    his hand on each one's shoulder.”
-   **Do not be afraid** – This could also be translated as, “Stop
being
    afraid.”
-   **Get up** - This could also be translated as, “Stand up” or,
    “Please get up.” Make sure that it sounds like Jesus spoke this
    with kindness.
-   **the only one still there was Jesus** - It is also possible to add,
    “Moses and Elijah had left.”

Keep the Secret 36-07
=======================


**Jesus** and the three **disciples** went back down the mountain. Then
Jesus said to them, “Do not tell anyone yet about what happened
here. I will soon **die** and then come back to **life**. After that,
you may tell people.”

*A Bible story from: Matthew 17:1-9; Mark 9:2-8; Luke 9:28-36*

Translation Notes:
------------------

-   *A Bible story from* - These references may be slightly different in
    some Bible translations.

Lazarus Was Sick 37-01
========================


**One day**, **Jesus** received a message that **Lazarus** was very
sick. Lazarus and his two sisters, **Mary** and Martha, were close friends
of Jesus. When Jesus heard this news, he said, “**This sickness will
not end in death**, but **it is for the glory of God**.” Jesus **loved**
his friends, **but he waited where he was for two days**.

Translation Notes:
------------------

-   **One day** - This phrase introduces an event that happened in the
    past, but does not state the specific time. Many languages have a
    similar way to begin telling a true story.
-   **Mary** - Jesus' mother was also named Mary. This was a different
    woman.
-   **this sickness will not end in death** - This can also be
    translated as, “the final result of this sickness will not be
    death” or, “Lazarus is sick, but death is not the final result
    of this sickness.” Jesus' disciples probably thought this meant
    that Lazarus would not die. But Jesus knew that, although Lazarus
    would die from his sickness, he would live in the end.
-   **it is for the glory of God** - That is, “this will cause people to
    praise God for how great he is.”
-   **but he waited where he was for two days** - This could be
    translated as, “but he stayed where he was for two days, even
    though they wanted him to go and heal Lazarus.”

Back to Judea 37-02
=====================


After the two days had passed, **Jesus** said to his **disciples**,
“Let’s go back to **Judea**.” “But **Teacher**,” the disciples
answered, “Just a short time ago the people there wanted to kill
you!” Jesus said, “Our friend **Lazarus** **has fallen asleep,
and I must wake him**.”

Translation Notes:
------------------

-   **Judea** - This refers to the southern section of Israel, which was
    settled by the tribe of Judah. Some languages will prefer to say,
    “the region of Judea.”
-   **has fallen asleep, and I must wake him.** - Translate this phrase
    with the normal words for “asleep” and “wake” in your
    language.  Although Jesus was using these words with a different
    meaning, the disciples did not understand that yet.

Lazarus Was Dead 37-03
========================


**Jesus'** **disciples** replied, “**Master**, if **Lazarus** is
sleeping, then **he will get better**.” Then Jesus told them plainly,
“**Lazarus is dead**. **I am glad** that I was not there, so that you
may **believe** in me.”

Translation Notes:
------------------

-   **he will get better** - The disciples intended this in the sense
    of, “there is no reason for us to go to him now, since he will
    get well.”
-   **I am glad** - This could be translated as, “I am happy” or,
“It is
    good that.” It does not mean he was happy that Lazarus died, but
    rather that he was happy that God was going to show how great he is.

Martha Met Jesus 37-04
========================


When **Jesus** arrived at **Lazarus'** hometown, Lazarus had already
been **dead** for four days.  **Martha** **went out to meet Jesus**
and said, “**Master**, if only you had been here, **my brother would
not have died**. But I **believe** **God** **will give you whatever you
ask from him**.”

Translation Notes:
------------------

-   **Martha** - Martha was the sister of Lazarus and Mary. See -
**went out to meet Jesus** – That is, “went to meet Jesus as he was
    coming into the town.”
-   **my brother would not have died.** - That is, “you would have
    healed my brother and he would not have died” or, “you could
    have prevented my brother from dying.”
-   **will give you whatever you ask from him** – That is, “will do
    whatever you ask him to do.”

I Am the Resurrection 37-05
=============================


**Jesus** replied, “**I am the Resurrection and the Life**. Whoever
**believes** in me **will live, even though he dies**. Everyone who
believes in me **will never die**. Do you believe this?” **Martha**
answered, “Yes, **Master**! I believe you are the **Messiah**, the
**Son of God**.”

Translation Notes:
------------------

-   **I am the Resurrection and the Life** - This is one of several very
    powerful “I am” statements in which Jesus says something about
    his essential nature. In this one, Jesus indicated that he is the
    “provider” or, “source” of resurrection and life. If possible,
    translate this phrase in a way that makes it clear that this is his
    essential nature. This can also be translated as, “I am the one
    who resurrects people and causes them to live.”
-   **will live, even though he dies.** - That is, “will live forever,
    even if he dies.” The English word, “he” does not only refer
    to men.  Women who believe in Jesus will also live forever.
-   **Martha** - Martha was the sister of Lazarus and Mary. See -
**will never die** - This can also be translated as, “will live
    forever.”

Mary Met Jesus 37-06
======================


Then **Mary** arrived. She **fell at the feet of Jesus** and said,
“**Master**, if only you had been here, **my brother would not have
died**.” Jesus asked them, “Where have you put **Lazarus**?” They
told him, “In the **tomb**. Come and see.” Then Jesus wept.

Translation Notes:
------------------

-   **Mary** - This was the same woman as in
    not the mother of Jesus.
-   **fell at the feet of Jesus** - That is, “knelt down at Jesus'
feet”
    as a sign of respect.
-   **my brother would not have died.** - That is, “you could have kept
    my brother from dying” or, “you could have prevented my brother's
    death” or, “my brother would still be alive.”

Open the Tomb 37-07
=====================


The **tomb** was a cave with a stone rolled in front of its opening. When
**Jesus** arrived at the tomb, **he told them**, “**Roll the
stone away**.” But **Martha** said, “**He has been dead for four
days**. There will be a bad smell.”

Translation Notes:
------------------

-   **he told them** - That is, “he told the men there.” He was
probably
    not telling Mary and Martha to roll the stone away.
-   **Roll the stone away** - Some languages may prefer to say, “Roll
    the stone away from the opening of the tomb.”
-   **Martha** - Martha was the sister of Lazarus and Mary. See -   **He
has been dead for four days** - This could also be translated
    as, “He died four days ago and his body is lying there.”

Rolling the Stone Away 37-08
==============================


**Jesus** responded, “**Did I not tell you** that you would **see God's
glory** if you **believe** in me?” So they **rolled the stone away**.

Translation Notes:
------------------

-   **Did I not tell you?** - That is, “Remember that I told you.”
Jesus
    is not asking this question in order to get an answer, so some
    languages should translate this as a command.
-   **see God's glory** - That is, “see the glory of God displayed”
or,
    “see God show how great he is.”
-   **rolled the stone away** - Some languages should say, “rolled the
    stone away from the opening of the tomb.”

Jesus' Prayer 37-09
=====================


Then **Jesus** looked up to **heaven** and said, “**Father**, thank you
for **hearing me**. I know you always listen to me, but I say this for
the sake of all these people standing here, so that they will **believe**
you sent me.” Then Jesus shouted, “**Lazarus**, **come out**!”

Translation Notes:
------------------

-   **hearing me** – That is, “listening to me.” It may be
helpful to
    add, “as I pray to you” or, “when I talk to you.”
-   **come out** - Some languages may prefer to say, “come out of the
    tomb.”

Lazarus Was Alive Again 37-10
===============================


So **Lazarus came out!** He was still wrapped in **grave clothes**.
**Jesus** told them, “Help him take off those grave clothes and
release him!” Many of the **Jews** **believed** in Jesus **because of
this miracle**.

Translation Notes:
------------------

-   **Lazarus came out!** - Some languages should say, “Lazarus came out
    of the tomb!”
-   **grave clothes** - That is, “burial clothes.” This can also be
    translated as, “burial bandages” or, “strips of cloth.”
-   **because of this miracle** – That is, “because God had done this
    amazing miracle” or, “because Jesus had made Lazarus come alive
    again.”

The Leaders Were Jealous 37-11
================================


But the **religious leaders** of the **Jews** were **jealous**,
so they **gathered together** to plan how they could kill **Jesus**
and **Lazarus**.

*A Bible story from: John 11:1-46*

Translation Notes:
------------------

-   **jealous** - That is, “jealous of Jesus' power and popularity”
or,
    “jealous that so many Jews were believing in Jesus.”
-   **gathered together** - That is, “met together” or, “joined
    together.” This was a not a casual meeting, but a meeting for a
    specific purpose–to plan how to kill Jesus.
-   *A Bible story from* - These references may be slightly different in
    some Bible translations.

The Passover 38-01
====================


Every year, the **Jews** celebrated the **Passover**. This was
a celebration of how **God** had **saved** their ancestors from
**slavery** in **Egypt** **many centuries earlier**. About three years
after **Jesus** first began **preaching** and teaching publicly, Jesus
told his **disciples** that he wanted to celebrate this Passover with
them in **Jerusalem**, and that he would be killed there.

Translation Notes:
------------------

-   **many centuries earlier** - That is, “hundreds of years earlier”
    or, “a very long time before.”

Judas Made a Deal 38-02
=========================


One of **Jesus'** **disciples** was a man named **Judas**. Judas was
**in charge of the apostles' moneybag**, but he **loved money** and
often stole money out of the bag. After Jesus and the disciples arrived
in **Jerusalem**, Judas went to the **Jewish leaders** and offered to
**betray** Jesus to them in exchange for money. He knew that the Jewish
leaders denied that Jesus was the **Messiah** and that they were plotting
to kill him.

Translation Notes:
------------------

-   **in charge of the apostles’ moneybag** - That is, “responsible to
    hold the apostles' money” or, “responsible to hold the bag that
    had the disciples' money in it and to distribute funds from it.”
-   **loved money** – That is, “highly valued money” or, “wanted
money.”
    Some languages would not use the same word that can be used for
    “loved people.”

Thirty Pieces of Silver 38-03
===============================


The **Jewish leaders**, led by the **high priest**, paid **Judas**
**thirty silver coins** to **betray** **Jesus**. This happened just as
the **prophets** had predicted. Judas agreed, took the money, and went
away. He began looking for an opportunity to help them arrest Jesus.

Translation Notes:
------------------

-   **thirty silver coins** - Each of these coins were worth about four
    days' wages.

This Is My Body 38-04
=======================


In Jerusalem, **Jesus** **celebrated** the **Passover** with his
**disciples**. During the Passover meal, Jesus **took some bread**
and **broke it**. He said, “Take and eat this. **This is my body**,
which is **given for you.** **Do this to remember me.**” In this way,
Jesus said that his body would be **sacrificed** for them.

Translation Notes:
------------------

-   **celebrated** – That is, “was celebrating.” -   **took some
bread** – This could be translated as, “picked up a
    piece of bread” or, “picked up a flat loaf of bread.”
-   **broke it** – Some languages should say, “tore it in pieces”
or,
    “tore it in half” or, “tore off part of it.”
-   **given for you** - This can also be translated as, “which I give
    for you.”
-   **Do this to remember me** - That is, “Do this as a way to remind
    yourselves of what I am doing for you.” Jesus was referring to
    his death, which would happen soon.

This Is My Blood 38-05
========================


Then **Jesus** picked up a cup and said, “**Drink this.** **It is my
blood of the New Covenant** that **is poured out** **for the forgiveness
of sins**. Do this to **remember me** every time you drink it.”

Translation Notes:
------------------

-   **a cup** – That is, “a cup of wine” or, “a cup full of a
drink made
    from grapes.”
-   **Drink this** - That is, “Drink what is in this cup” or, “Drink
    from this cup.” The drink in the cup was made from grapes so that
    it had a deep red color.
-   **blood of the New Covenant** – This could be translated as,
“blood
    that makes the New Covenant possible” or, “blood that is the
    basis for the New Covenant.”
-   **is poured out** - This could be translated as, “will run out of my
    body” or, “I will bleed out.”
-   **for the forgiveness of sins** - That is, “so that God can
    completely forgive people for all of their sins.”
-   **remember me** - That is, “celebrate me” or, “commemorate
me.” It
    could also be translated as, “especially focus on me” or,
    “remind you of me.”

The Betrayer 38-06
====================


Then **Jesus** said to the **disciples**, “One of you will **betray**
me.” The disciples were shocked, and asked who would do such a
thing. Jesus said, “The person to whom I give this piece of bread **is
the betrayer**.” Then he gave the bread to **Judas**.

Translation Notes:
------------------

-   **give this piece of bread** – That is, “hand this piece of
bread.” -   **is the betrayer** - This could also be translated as,
“will betray
    me” or, “is the one who will betray me.”

Satan Entered Judas 38-07
===========================


After **Judas** took the bread, **Satan entered into him**. **Judas
left and went** to help the **Jewish** leaders arrest Jesus.  **It was
nighttime.**

Translation Notes:
------------------

-   **Satan entered into him.** - That is, “Satan went into him” or,
    “Satan took control of him.”
-   **Judas left and went** - Some languages may prefer to say, “Judas
    left the meal and went” or, “Judas left the room and went
    outside.”

You Will Be Scattered 38-08
=============================


After the meal, **Jesus** and his **disciples** walked to the **Mount
of Olives**. Jesus said, “You will all **abandon me** tonight. **It
is written**, ‘**I will strike the shepherd** and **all the sheep will
be scattered**.’”

Translation Notes:
------------------

-   **Mount of Olives** - This is the name of a hill covered with olive
    trees, just outside the walls of the city of Jerusalem. It can also
    be translated as, “Olive Tree Hill.”
-   **abandon me** – That is, “desert me” or, “leave me.” -
**It is written** - That is, “It is written in God's word” or, “It
    is written in the scriptures” or, “One of God's prophets wrote.”
    It is also possible to say, “What is written will happen” or,
    “It will be like what is written.” This prophecy refers to Jesus'
    death and his followers running away.
-   **I will strike** - That is, “I will kill.” -   **the shepherd
and all the sheep** - Do not use Jesus' name in this
    quote because the prophet who first wrote it would not have known
    the shepherd's name. Also, do not refer to the sheep being the
    disciples. It is best to use words that mean “shepherd” and
    “sheep” in your translation.
-   **will be scattered** - That is, “will go away in different
    directions.”

Jesus Prayed for Peter 38-09
==============================


**Peter** replied, “Even if all the others **abandon you**, I will
not!” Then **Jesus** said to Peter, “**Satan** wants **to have all
of you**, but I have **prayed** for you, Peter, **that your faith will
not fail**. Even so, tonight, **before the rooster crows**, you will
deny that you even know me three times.”

Translation Notes:
------------------

-   **abandon you** – Check to see how you translated this in -   **to
have all of you** - That is, “to completely control you” or,
    “to get you to serve him completely.” The word “you” is
    plural in this phrase. All of the words “you” and “your”
    that follow are singular.
-   **that your faith will not fail** - That is, “that you will not stop
    believing in me.”
-   **before the rooster crows** - Roosters normally crow at the first
    light of the new day. If that is not clear, it may be helpful to say,
    “Before the rooster crows at dawn tomorrow” or, “before the
    rooster crows tomorrow morning.”

Peter's Promise 38-10
=======================


**Peter** then said to **Jesus**, “Even if I must **die**, I will
never **deny you**!” All the other **disciples** said the same thing.

Translation Notes:
------------------

-   **deny you** - That is, “deny that I know you” or, “deny that
I am
    your disciple” or, “disown you.”

At Gethsemane 38-11
=====================


Then **Jesus** went with his **disciples** to **a place called
Gethsemane**. Jesus told his disciples to **pray** that they would not
**enter into temptation**.  Then Jesus went to pray **by himself**.

Translation Notes:
------------------

-   **a place called Gethsemane** - This could be translated as, “a
    nearby place called Gethsemane” or, “a place called Gethsemane
    at the foot of the Mount of Olives.”
-   **enter into temptation** - That is, “would not sin when they were
    tempted” or, “would not give in to the temptation they were
    about to experience.”
-   **by himself** – This could be translated as, “alone.”

Your Will Be Done 38-12
=========================


**Jesus** **prayed** three times, “**My Father**, if it is possible,
please let me not have to **drink this cup of suffering**. But if there
is no other way for people’s **sins** to be **forgiven**, then **let
your will be done**.” Jesus was very troubled and **his sweat was like
drops of blood**.  **God** sent an **angel** to strengthen him.

Translation Notes:
------------------

-   **drink this cup of suffering** - That is, “go through this
    suffering” or, “suffer what is about to happen” or, “endure
    this suffering.”
-   **let your will be done** - This expression means, “do what you have
    planned” or, “do what needs to be done.”

The Disciples Slept 38-13
===========================


**After each time of prayer**, **Jesus** came back to his **disciples**,
but they were asleep. When he returned the third time, Jesus said,
“Wake up!  My **betrayer** is here.”

Translation Notes:
------------------

-   **After each time of prayer** - That is, “Every time Jesus prayed
    that prayer.” This refers to the three times he prayed, as
    mentioned in

Judas Betrayed Jesus 38-14
============================


**Judas** came with the **Jewish leaders**, soldiers, and a large
crowd. They were carrying swords and clubs. Judas **came to** **Jesus**
and said, “**Greetings**, **Teacher**,” and kissed him. This was
**the sign** for the Jewish leaders to know whom to arrest. Then Jesus
said, “Judas, **do you betray me with a kiss**?”

Translation Notes:
------------------

-   **came to** - Some languages may prefer to say, “went to.”
-   **Greetings** - This can also be translated as, “Hello” or,
“Peace”
    or, “Good evening.”
-   **the sign** - That is, “the signal.” -   **do you betray me
with a kiss?** - That is, “are you really going
    to betray me with a kiss?” Jesus is not looking for an answer to
    this question. So some languages would translate it as a statement,
    such as, “you are betraying me by kissing me!” or, “you make
    your betrayal even worse by kissing me!”

Peter Fought for Jesus 38-15
==============================


**As the soldiers arrested Jesus**, **Peter** **pulled out his
sword** and cut off the ear of a **servant** of the **high priest**.
Jesus said, “Put the sword away! I could ask the **Father** for an
army of **angels** to defend me. But **I must obey my Father**.” Then
Jesus **healed** the man’s ear.  After Jesus was arrested, all the
**disciples** ran away.

*A Bible story from: Matthew 26:14-56; Mark 14:10-50; Luke 22:1-53;
John 12:6; 18:1-11*

Translation Notes:
------------------

-   **As the soldiers arrested Jesus** - That is, “While the soldiers
    were arresting Jesus.”
-   **pulled out his sword** - That is, “pulled out his sword from the
    place where he was carrying it.”
-   **I must obey my Father** - That is, “I won't do that because I must
    obey my Father's will and allow myself to be arrested.”
-   *A Bible story from* - These references may be slightly different in
    some Bible translations.

The House of the High Priest 39-01
====================================


It was now **the middle of the night**. The soldiers led **Jesus**
to the house of the **high priest** in order for the high priest **to
question him**.  **Peter** followed far behind them. When Jesus was
taken into the house, Peter stayed outside and warmed himself by a fire.

Translation Notes:
------------------

-   **the middle of the night** - This expression means, “halfway
    through the night” or, “very late at night.”
-   **to question him** – That is, “to ask Jesus questions to try to
    find something they could accuse Jesus of doing wrong.”

The False Witnesses 39-02
===========================


Inside the house, the **Jewish leaders** **put Jesus on trial**. They
brought many false **witnesses** who **lied about him**. However, **their
statements did not agree with each other**, so the Jewish leaders could
not prove **he was guilty of anything**. Jesus did not say anything.

Translation Notes:
------------------

-   **put Jesus on trial** – This could be translated as, “had
a formal
    meeting to accuse Jesus of doing something wrong.” Usually a
    trial is done to find out if someone is innocent or guilty of a
    certain crime. In this case, the leaders were determined to make
    Jesus seem guilty.
-   **lied about him** - That is, “told lies about him” or, “falsely
    accused him of doing something wrong.”
-   **their statements did not agree with each other** - This could be
    translated as, “they said things about Jesus that were very
    different from each other” or, “the witnesses said things about
    Jesus that contradicted each other.”
-   **he was guilty of anything** – That is, “that he had done
anything
    wrong.”

Are You the Son of God? 39-03
===============================


Finally, the **high priest** looked directly at **Jesus** and said,
“Tell us, are you the **Messiah**, the **Son of the living God**?”

Translation Notes:
------------------

-   **Finally** - That is, “After they were unable to find any evidence
    against him” or, “After they were unable to prove that he was
    guilty.”

I Am the Son of God 39-04
===========================


**Jesus** said, “**I am**, and you will see me **seated with God
and coming from heaven**.” The **high priest** **tore his clothes in
anger** and shouted to the other **religious leaders**, “We do not need
any more **witnesses**! You have heard him say that he is the **Son of
God**. **What is your judgment**?”

Translation Notes:
------------------

-   **I am** - That is, “I am as you said” or, “I am the Messiah
and the
    Son of God.” “I am” is also the name of God (See By saying
    simply, “I am” Jesus was also saying that he is God. If possible,
    translate this so that people will see a similarity between Jesus'
    answer and the name of God.
-   **seated with God** - This could be translated as, “reigning with
    God.” Because God is the ruler over all, people talk about him
    as sitting on a throne in heaven. By saying that he would be seated
    with God, Jesus claimed that he had authority to rule with the Father.
-   **seated with God and coming from heaven** – This could be
    translated as, “sitting beside God and then coming from heaven.”
-   **tore his clothes in anger** - The Jews would tear their clothes to
    show grief or anger. If tearing the clothes means something else in
    your language, you may want to substitute a phrase such as, “he
    was extremely angry.”
-   **What is your judgment?** - That is, “What is your decision?” or,
    “Tell us what have you decided: Is he innocent or guilty?”
    The chief priest wanted the religious leaders to condemn Jesus for
    claiming to be equal with God.

They Mocked Jesus 39-05
=========================


The **Jewish leaders** all answered the **high priest**, “He deserves
to **die**!” Then **they blindfolded Jesus**, **spit on him**, hit him,
and **mocked** him.

Translation Notes:
------------------

-   **they blindfolded Jesus** - That is. “they covered Jesus' eyes so
    that he could not see.”
-   **spit on him** - This could also be translated as, “spit on him to
    insult him” or, “spit on him in order to say that he was
    worthless.” This was a way of showing contempt for someone.

Peter and the Servant Girl 39-06
==================================


As **Peter** was waiting outside the house, a **servant girl** saw him
and said to him, “You also were with **Jesus**!” Peter **denied
it**. Later, another girl said the same thing, and **Peter denied it
again**. Finally, the people said, “We know that you were with Jesus
because you both **are from Galilee**.”

Translation Notes:
------------------

-   **denied it** - This can be translated as, “said that it was not
    true” or, “said that he was not with Jesus” or, “said,
    'No. That is not true.'”
-   **Peter denied it again** – This could be translated as, “Peter
    denied knowing Jesus a second time” or, “again Peter said he
    had not been with Jesus.”
-   **are from Galilee** - This could also be translated as, “are
    Galileans.” The people could tell from the way Jesus and Peter
    talked that they came from the region of Galilee.

Peter Denied Jesus 39-07
==========================


Then **Peter vowed**, saying, “**May God curse me if I know this
man**!” Immediately, **a rooster crowed**, and **Jesus** turned around
and looked at Peter.

Translation Notes:
------------------

-   **vowed** - That is, “said emphatically” or, “said very
strongly.” -   **May God curse me if I know this man** - This is a
curse that
    means, “May God cause harm to me if what you say is true” or,
    “May God punish me if I am lying to you!” In this way Peter was
    saying very strongly that he did not know Jesus. He also referred
    to Jesus as, “this man” to make it sound like he did not know him.
-   **a rooster crowed** - “Crowing” is the loud sound that a rooster
    makes. Compare how you translated this in

Judas Killed Himself 39-08
============================


**Peter** went away and **cried bitterly**. Meanwhile, **Judas**, **the
betrayer**, saw that the **Jewish leaders** **had condemned Jesus to
die**. Judas became full of sorrow and went away and killed himself.

Translation Notes:
------------------

-   **cried bitterly** - That is, “cried, feeling deep sorrow” or,
    “cried, feeling deep regret.”
-   **the betrayer** – That is, “who had betrayed Jesus” or,
“who had
    helped the leaders arrest Jesus.”
-   **had condemned Jesus to die** - That is, “had said that Jesus was
    guilty and must die.”

Jesus and Pilate 39-09
========================


Early the next morning, the **Jewish leaders** brought **Jesus** to
**Pilate**, the **Roman governor**. They hoped that Pilate would condemn
Jesus as guilty and **sentence him to be killed**. Pilate asked Jesus,
“Are you the **king of the Jews**?”

Translation Notes:
------------------

-   **Roman governor** - That is, “Roman government official.”
The Roman
    government had appointed Pilate to govern the region of Judea
    in Israel.
-   **sentence him to be killed** - As governor, Pilate had the
    authority to condemn Jesus to death and to give approval for his
    crucifixion, or to set him free. The Jewish religious leaders did
    not have the authority to have someone killed.

What Is Truth? 39-10
======================


**Jesus** answered, “**You have said so**, but **my kingdom is not an
earthly kingdom**. If it were, **my servants would fight for me**. I have
come to earth to tell the **truth** about **God**. Everyone who **loves**
the truth **listens to me**.” **Pilate** said, “**What is truth?**”

Translation Notes:
------------------

-   **You have said so** - That is, “You have spoken correctly.” -
**my kingdom is not an earthly kingdom** - That is, “my kingdom is
    not like earthly kingdoms.”
-   **my servants would fight for me** - That is, “my disciples would
    fight to protect me” so that I could establish my kingdom.
-   **listens to me** – This could be translated as, “hears my
teaching
    and obeys me.” It includes not just hearing Jesus' words, but also
    doing what he says.
-   **What is truth?** - that is, “Can anyone know what is true?”

He Is Not Guilty 39-11
========================


After speaking with **Jesus**, **Pilate** went out to the crowd and
said, “**I find no guilt in this man**.” But the **Jewish leaders**
and the crowd shouted, “**Crucify** him!” Pilate replied, “**He
is not guilty**.” But they shouted even louder.  Then Pilate said a
third time, “He is not guilty!”

Translation Notes:
------------------

-   **I find no guilt in this man** - That is, “I do not find this man
    to be guilty” or, “I have examined this man, and I do not see
    that he has done anything wrong.”
-   **He is not guilty** - That is, “He has done nothing wrong!”

The King of the Jews 39-12
============================


**Pilate** became afraid that the crowd would begin to **riot**, so he
ordered his soldiers to **crucify** **Jesus**. The **Roman** soldiers
whipped Jesus and put **a royal robe** and a **crown made of thorns**
on him.  Then they **mocked** him by saying, “**Look**, **the King of
the Jews**!”

*A Bible story from: Matthew 26:57-27:26; Mark 14:53-15:15; Luke
22:54-23:25; John 18:12-19:16*

Translation Notes:
------------------

-   **riot** - That is, “start doing violent things in their anger.” -
**a royal robe** - That is, “a robe like a king's robe.” This robe
    had a bright color, so it looked like the kind of robe that a king
    would wear.
-   **crown made of thorns** - This means that they tied thorn branches
    into a circle to look like a crown. A crown is an ornament that a
    king wears on his head to show his authority. But the crown that
    they put on Jesus' head had sharp, dangerous thorns on it.
-   **Look** – That is, “Look at” or, ”Here is.” -   **the
King of the Jews** – Since the soldiers were mocking Jesus,
    this could be translated as, “the so-called King of the Jews.”
-   *A Bible story from* - These references may be slightly different in
    some Bible translations.

Jesus Carried His Cross 40-01
===============================


After the soldiers **mocked** **Jesus**, they **led him away** **to
crucify him**. They made him carry the **cross** on which he would die.

Translation Notes:
------------------

-   **led him away** – That is, “forced him to go with them.”
This could
    also be translated as, “took him away.”
-   **to crucify him** - That is, “to kill him on a cross.”

Jesus Was Nailed to the Cross 40-02
=====================================


The soldiers brought **Jesus** to a place called “**the Skull**” and
nailed his arms and feet to the **cross**. But Jesus said, “**Father**,
**forgive them, because they do not know what they are doing**.”
**Pilate** commanded that they write, “**King of the Jews**” on a
sign and put it on the cross above Jesus’ head.

Translation Notes:
------------------

-   **the Skull** - A hill near Jerusalem with a white, rocky top that
    was shaped somewhat like the top of a skull.
-   **forgive them, because they do not know what they are doing** -
    That is, “they do not understand the meaning of what they are
    doing, so please forgive them.” The soldiers thought Jesus was
    only a criminal who deserved to die. They did not understand that
    he was the Son of God.

Gambling for His Clothes 40-03
================================


The soldiers **gambled for Jesus' clothing**. When they did this, **they
fulfilled a prophecy that said**, “They divided my garments among them,
and gambled for my clothing.”

Translation Notes:
------------------

-   **gambled for Jesus' clothing** - That is, “played a game of chance
    to win Jesus' clothes.” We do not know how they did this, but in
    some cultures it could be translated as, “tossed stones on the
    ground to win Jesus' clothing” or, “chose sticks to decide who
    could take Jesus' clothes.”
-   **they fulfilled a prophecy that said** - That is, “they did what
    the scriptures had long ago predicted would happen to the Messiah”
    or, “they did what a prophet wrote long ago.”

The Two Robbers 40-04
=======================


**Jesus** was **crucified** between **two robbers**. One of them
**mocked** Jesus, but the other said, “Do you have no fear of
**God**? **We are guilty, but this man is innocent**.” Then he said to
Jesus, “**Please remember me** **in your kingdom**.” Jesus answered
him, “Today, you will be with me in **Paradise**.”

Translation Notes:
------------------

-   **two robbers** - This could also be translated as, “two bandits.”
    This refers to criminals who used force or violence to steal things.
-   **Do you have no fear of God?** - The robber does not expect an
    answer to this question; it is a way that some languages use to make
    a strong statement. If your language does not use questions in this
    way, then translate this as, “You should fear God!”
-   **We are guilty but this man is innocent** – This could be
    translated as, “You and I have done evil things and deserve to die,
    but this man, Jesus, has done nothing wrong and does not deserve to
    die.” “We” here includes both robbers, but does not include
    Jesus.
-   **this man** - This phrase refers to Jesus.  -   **Please remember
me** - That is, “Please accept me” or, “Please
    welcome me” or, “Please allow me to be with you.” “Remember”
    here does not mean to recall something after forgetting it. Translate
    this in a way that communicates a humble request.
-   **in your kingdom** – That is, “when you establish your
kingdom” or,
    “when you are ruling as king.”
-   **Paradise** - This is another name for “heaven.”

Come Down from the Cross 40-05
================================


The **Jewish leaders** and the other people in the crowd **mocked**
**Jesus**. They said to him, “If you are the **Son of God**, come down
from the **cross** and **save** yourself! Then we will **believe** you.”

Translation Notes:
------------------

-   **believe you** – That is, “believe in you” or, “believe
that you
    are the Messiah.”

The Darkness 40-06
====================


Then the sky over the whole region became completely dark, even though
it was the middle of the day. It stayed dark from noon until 3:00 in
the afternoon.

Translation Notes:
------------------

-   **

Jesus Died 40-07
==================


Then **Jesus** cried out, “**It is finished!** **Father**, I give
my **spirit** **into your hands**.” Then he **bowed his head** and
**gave up his spirit**. When he **died**, there was an earthquake and the
**large curtain** that separated the people from the presence of **God**
in the **Temple** was torn in two, from the top to the bottom.

Translation Notes:
------------------

-   **It is finished!** - This could also be translated as, “It is
    completed” or, “I have finished it” or, “I have completed
    the work.” This means that Jesus' work of salvation was complete.
-   **into your hands** - That is, “into your care.” -   **bowed his
head** – That is, “lowered his head.” -   **gave up his spirit**
- That is, “gave up his spirit to God” or,
    “released his spirit to God and died.”
-   **large curtain** - This was a large, strong fabric hung in the
    temple. It was like a wall separating one room from another. It can
    also be translated as “thick curtain” or, “hanging fabric”
    or, “screen.”

The Soldier's Testimony 40-08
===============================


**Through his death**, **Jesus** **opened a way** for people to **come
to God**.  When the soldier guarding Jesus saw everything that had
happened, he said, “Certainly, this man was **innocent**. He was the
**Son of God**.”

Translation Notes:
------------------

-   **Through his death** - That is, “By means of his death” or, “By
    dying.”
-   **opened a way** - That is, “made it possible.” -   **come to
God** - That is, “come near to God” or, “go near to God”
    or, “approach God” or, “know God personally.” The tearing

    been removed.

The Burial of Jesus 40-09
===========================


Then **Joseph** and Nicodemus, two **Jewish leaders** who **believed**
**Jesus** was the **Messiah**, **asked Pilate for Jesus’ body**.
They wrapped his body in cloth and placed it in a **tomb** cut out
of rock. Then they rolled a large stone in front of the tomb to block
the opening.

*A Bible story from: Matthew 27:27-61; Mark 15:16-47; Luke 23:26-56;
John 19:17-42*

    Joseph.
-   **asked Pilate for Jesus' body** – That is, “asked Pilate
to permit
    them to take Jesus' body down from the cross.”
-   *A Bible story from* - These references may be slightly different in
    some Bible translations.

Guards for the Tomb 41-01
===========================


After the soldiers **crucified** **Jesus**, **the unbelieving Jewish
leaders** said to **Pilate**, “**That liar, Jesus, said** he would
**rise from the dead** after three days.  Someone must guard the **tomb**
to make sure that his **disciples** do not steal the body and then say
he has risen from the dead.”

Translation Notes:
------------------

-   **the unbelieving Jewish leaders** - That is, “the Jewish leaders
    who did not believe in Jesus.”
-   **That liar, Jesus, said** – This could also be translated as,
“That
    man, Jesus, lied and said.” They refused to believe that Jesus
    told the truth about being the Son of God.
-   **rise from the dead** - That is, “come back to life” or,
“become
    alive again.”

The Tomb Was Sealed 41-02
===========================


**Pilate** said, “Take some soldiers and make the **tomb** as secure as
you can.” So **they placed a seal on the stone** at the entrance of the
tomb and put the soldiers there to make sure no one could steal the body.

Translation Notes:
------------------

-   **they placed** - That is, “the religious leaders and the soldiers
    placed.”
-   **a seal on the stone** - They put a soft material like clay or wax
    between the stone and the tomb and marked it with an official seal.
    If anyone moved the stone, the material would break and show that
    someone had entered the tomb. This could also be translated as,
    “a mark on the stone to forbid people from moving it.”

The Women 41-03
=================


The day after **Jesus** was buried was a **Sabbath** day, and **the Jews
were not permitted** to go to a **tomb** on that day. So very early
on the morning after the Sabbath day, several women prepared to go to
Jesus’ **tomb** to put more **burial spices** on his body.

Translation Notes:
------------------

-   **the Jews were not permitted** – The Sabbath day rules did not
    permit a Jew to walk very far or to do any other kind of work.
-   **burial spices** - This refers to sweet-smelling spices that were
    placed on a dead body to cover the bad smell. This can also be
    translated as, “sweet-smelling spices” or, “sweet-smelling
    oils” or, “sweet-smelling plants.”

The Angel Appeared 41-04
==========================


Suddenly, there was a **great earthquake**. An **angel** **that shone as
bright as lightning** appeared from **heaven**. He rolled away the stone
that was covering the entrance to the **tomb** and sat on it. The soldiers
guarding the tomb were terrified and **fell to the ground like dead men**.

Translation Notes:
------------------

-   **great earthquake** – This could also be translated as, “violent
    earthquake” or, “forceful shaking of the ground.” Some
    languages may prefer to reword this as, “the ground began to

    was as bright as lightning.”
-   **fell to the ground like dead men** - They were not dead, but they
    did not move, just like dead men do not move. They probably had
    fainted from fright. To make this clear, this could be translated as,
    “suddenly fell to the ground and did not move.”

Jesus Is Risen 41-05
======================


When the women arrived at the tomb, the **angel** told them, “**Do
not be afraid**. **Jesus** is not here. **He has risen from the dead**,
just like he said he would! Look in the **tomb** and see.” The women
looked into the tomb and saw where Jesus' body had been laid. His body
was not there!

Translation Notes:
------------------

-   **Do not be afraid** - That is, “Stop being afraid.” An angel
    shining like lightning was a frightening sight!
-   **He has risen from the dead** – This could be translated as, “He
    has come back to life.”

Tell the Disciples 41-06
==========================


Then the **angel** told the women, “Go and tell the **disciples**,
'**Jesus** has **risen** from the **dead** and **he will go to Galilee
ahead of you**.'”

Translation Notes:
------------------

emotions of
    fear and also great joy.”

Jesus Appeared to the Women 41-08
===================================


As the women were on their way to tell the **disciples** the good news,
**Jesus** appeared to them, and they **worshiped** him. Jesus said,
“Do not be afraid. Go and tell my disciples to go to **Galilee**. They
**will see me** there.”

*A Bible story from: Matthew 27:62-28:15; Mark 16:1-11; Luke 24:1-12;
John 20:1-18*

Translation Notes:
------------------

-   **will see me** - That is, “will meet me” or, “can meet with
me.” -   *A Bible story from* - These references may be slightly
different in
    some Bible translations.

The Two Disciples 42-01
=========================


On the day that **Jesus** was **raised** from the dead, two of
his **disciples** were going to a nearby town. As they walked, they
talked about what had happened to Jesus. They had hoped that he was the
**Messiah**, but then he was killed. Now the women said he was **alive**
again. They did not know what to **believe**.

Translation Notes:
------------------

-   **

Jesus Walked with the Disciples 42-02
=======================================


**Jesus** approached them and started walking with them, but they **did
not recognize him**. He asked what they were talking about, and they told
him about **all the remarkable things that had happened** concerning
Jesus during the previous few days. They thought they were talking to
a visitor who did not know what had happened in **Jerusalem**.

Translation Notes:
------------------

-   **did not recognize him** - That is, “did not know that it was
    Jesus.”

Then **Jesus** explained to them what **God’s word** said about the
**Messiah**. He reminded them that the **prophets** said the Messiah
would **suffer** and be killed, but would **rise** again **on the third
day**. When they arrived at the town where the two men planned to stay,
**it was almost evening**.

Translation Notes:
------------------

-   **on the third day** - Some languages may prefer to say, “on the
    third day after his death.”
-   **it was almost evening** - This can also be translated as, “the day
    was ending” or, “the sun was going down” or, “it was starting
    to get dark.”

Breaking the Bread 42-04
==========================


The two men invited **Jesus** to stay with them, so he did. When they
were ready to eat the evening meal, Jesus picked up a loaf of bread,
thanked **God** for it, and then broke it. Suddenly, they recognized that
he was Jesus.  But at that moment, **he disappeared from their sight**.

Translation Notes:
------------------

-   **he disappeared from their sight** - This could also be translated
    as, “he was gone” or, “he was no longer there.”

Jesus Is Alive 42-05
======================


The two men said to each other, “That was **Jesus**! That is why
**our hearts were burning** when he explained **God’s word** to us!”
Immediately, they went back to **Jerusalem**. When they arrived, they
told the **disciples**, “Jesus is **alive**! We have seen him!”

Translation Notes:
------------------

-   **our hearts were burning** - That is, “we were getting excited”
or,
    “we were beginning to hope” or, “we felt joy.” Some languages
    have ways of expressing it such as, “our hearts were stirred” or,
    “our hearts were warmed.” If you use an expression that refers
    to the heart burning, make sure it does not indicate that they were
    upset or angry.

Jesus Appeared to the Disciples 42-06
=======================================


As the **disciples** were talking, **Jesus** suddenly appeared in the
room with them and said, “**Peace to you**!” The **disciples**
thought he was a **ghost**, but Jesus said, “Why are you afraid and
**doubting**? Look at my hands and feet. Ghosts do not have bodies like
I do.” **To prove** that he was not a ghost, he asked for something
to eat. They gave him a piece of cooked fish, and he ate it.

Translation Notes:

from the dead **on the third day**.”

Translation Notes:

days
    later.”

You Are Witnesses 42-08
=========================

**proclaim** that everyone should **repent** in order to **receive**
**forgiveness** for their **sins**. **They will do this starting in
Jerusalem**, and then go to all **people groups** everywhere. **You are
witnesses of these things**.”

Translation Notes:

-   **proclaim** - That is, “announce” or, “preach.” -   **They
will do this starting in Jerusalem** - That is, “They will
    begin doing this in Jerusalem” or, “They will begin to proclaim

    that you have seen happen.”

Jesus Taught for Forty Days 42-09

times. Once, he even appeared to more than 500 people at the same time!
He proved to his disciples in many ways that he was **alive**, and he
taught them about the **kingdom of God**.

Translation Notes:
------------------

-   **

Make Disciples 42-10
======================


**Jesus** said to his **disciples**, “**All authority in heaven and
on earth has been given to me**. So go, **make disciples of all people
groups** by **baptizing** them **in the name of** the **Father**,
the **Son**, and the **Holy Spirit**, and by teaching them to **obey**
everything I have commanded you. Remember, I will be with you always.”

Translation Notes:
------------------

-   **All authority in heaven and on earth has been given to me** - This
    can also be translated as, “God has given me all authority in
    heaven and on earth” or, “God has given me complete authority
    over everyone in heaven and on earth” or, “I have all authority
    in heaven an on earth.”
-   **make disciples of all people groups** - That is, “help people from
    every people group become my disciples.”
-   **in the name of** - This phrase means both, “by the authority of”
    and, “under the authority of.” Consider translating the word
    “name” literally if it will be understood in this way in your
    language.  This phrase can also be repeated as in, “in the name
    of the Father, in the name of the Son, and in the name of the Holy
    Spirit.”

Jesus Went to Heaven 42-11
============================


Forty days after **Jesus** rose from the dead, he told his **disciples**,
“Stay in **Jerusalem** until my **Father** gives you **power** when the
**Holy Spirit** **comes on you**.” Then Jesus went up to **heaven**,
and **a cloud hid him from their sight**. Jesus sat down **at the right
hand of God** to rule **over all things**.

*A Bible story from: Matthew 28:16-20; Mark 16:12-20; Luke 24:13-53;
John 20:19-23; Acts 1:1-11*

Jews **celebrated the harvest**. Jews came from all over the world to
**Jerusalem** to celebrate Pentecost together. **This year**, the time for
Pentecost came about a week after **Jesus** had gone back to **heaven**.

Translation Notes:
------------------

-   **Pentecost** - “Pentecost” means “fiftieth .” You could use
    the word “Pentecost” in your translation and let the text explain
    the meaning. Or you could use a term that means, “50th day.”
-   **celebrated the harvest** - The Jews would thank God for the
    harvest by bringing offerings and celebrate by having special meals.
-   **This year** - That is, “In the year that Jesus died.”

Speaking Other Languages 43-03
================================


While the **believers** were all together, suddenly the house where they
were was filled with **a sound like a strong wind**. Then something
that looked like flames of fire appeared over the heads of all the
believers. They were all **filled with the Holy Spirit** and they began
to speak **in other languages**.

Translation Notes:
------------------

-   **a sound like a strong wind** - That is, “a noise that a strong
    wind makes” or, “the sound that the wind makes when it blows
    hard.”
-   **filled with the Holy Spirit** - That is, “given ability by the
    Holy Spirit” or, “given power by the Holy Spirit.”
-   **in other languages** - This could be translated as, “in languages
    other than their own language” or, “in foreign languages”
    or, “as people from other places speak.” The believers did not
    know these languages until the Holy Spirit gave them the power to
    speak them.  Make sure the word used to translate “languages”
    refers to languages people actually speak and understand.

The Crowd Gathered 43-04
==========================


When the people in **Jerusalem** heard the noise, **a crowd** came
to see what was happening. When the people heard the **believers**
proclaiming **the wonderful works of God**, they were astonished that
they were hearing these things in their own native languages.

Translation Notes:
------------------

-   **a crowd** – This could be translated as, “a crowd of people”

    amazing things that God had done.”

God's Spirit Was Poured Out 43-05
===================================


Some of the people **accused the disciples of being drunk**. But
**Peter** stood up and said to them, “Listen to me! These people
are not drunk! This **fulfills** the **prophecy** made by the prophet
**Joel** in which God said, ‘In **the last days**, I will **pour out
my Spirit**.’”

Translation Notes:
------------------

-   **accused the disciples of being drunk** - This could also be
    translated as, “said that the disciples were drunk.”
-   **Joel** - Joel was a prophet in Israel who lived hundreds of years
    before this happened.
-   **the last days** - This refers to, “the final days before the end
    of the world.”
-   **pour out my Spirit** - This can be understood in the sense of,
    “give my Spirit generously to people” or, “cause my Spirit to
    completely empower people.”
-   **my Spirit** - That is, “my Holy Spirit.”

You Crucified Jesus 43-06
===========================


“**Men of Israel**, **Jesus** was a man who did many mighty **signs
and wonders** by the **power** of **God**, as you have seen and already
know. But **you crucified him!**”

Translation Notes:
------------------

- -   **Men of Israel** – For some languages it is better to say,
“People
    of Israel” for it to be clear that this included men and women. This
    could also be translated as, “My fellow people of Israel” or,
    “My fellow Jews” to make it clear that Peter was also a Jew and
    belonged to the “people of Israel.”
-   **you crucified him!** - This could also be translated as, “you
    caused him to be crucified” or, “because of you, he was
    crucified.” The Jews did not actually nail Jesus to the
    cross. However, the Jewish leaders caused him to be condemned and
    many of the people in the crowd had shouted for him to be crucified.

God Raised Jesus 43-07
========================


“Although **Jesus** died, **God** **raised** him from the
**dead**. **This fulfills the prophecy which says**, ‘**You will not
let your** **Holy One** **rot in the grave**.’ We are **witnesses**
to the fact that God **raised Jesus to life again**.”

Translation Notes:
------------------

- -   **This fulfills the prophecy which says** – Another way to
translate
    this would be, “This caused to come true what one of the prophets
    said long ago.”
-   **You will not let your** - “You” and “your” refer to God the
    Father. To make that clear, this could be translated as, “You,
    God, will not let your.” Some languages may have a special way of
    addressing someone, such as, “You, O God.”
-   **rot in the grave** - That is, “decay in the tomb” or,
“decompose
    in the grave.” This refers to the fact that Jesus did not remain
    in the tomb very long and is another way of saying that he did not
    stay dead, but rather came back to life again.
-   **raised Jesus to life again** - That is, “made Jesus alive
again.”

The Holy Spirit 43-08
=======================


“**Jesus is now exalted** to **the right hand of** **God the
Father**. And Jesus has sent the **Holy Spirit** just as he **promised**

**God** has caused Jesus to become both **Lord** and **Messiah**!”

Translation Notes:
------------------

- -   **But know for certain that** – This could also be translated as,
    “But you can know that it is true that” or, “But you can be
    sure that.”

What Should We Do? 43-10
==========================


The people listening to **Peter** were **deeply moved by** the things
that he said. So they asked Peter and the **disciples**, “**Brothers**,
what should we do?”

Translation Notes:
------------------

-   **deeply moved by** - That is, “very troubled by” or, “felt
very sad
    when they heard.” To be “moved” is to feel strong emotions.
-   **Brothers** - This was a normal way for a Jew to address fellow
    Jews. It could also be translated as, “Friends.”

Repent and Be Baptized 43-11
==============================


**Peter** answered them, “Every one of you should **repent** and be
**baptized** **in the name of** **Jesus Christ** so that **God** will
**forgive** your **sins**. Then he will also give you the **gift of the
Holy Spirit**.”

Translation Notes:
------------------

-   **in the name of** - This phrase means both, “by the authority of”
    and, “under the authority of.” Consider translating the word
    “name” literally if it will be understood in this way in your
    language.
-   **Christ** – This is the same meaning as “Messiah.” It could be
    translated as “Anointed One” or, “Chosen One.” Instead of
    translating the meaning, some translators may choose to keep the
    word “Christ” and spell it using the sounds in their own language.
-   **Jesus Christ** – Since “Christ” is a title here, some
translators
    may choose to change the order and say, “Christ Jesus.” Both
    orders are used in the Bible.

3000 Believe 43-12
====================


About 3,000 people **believed** what **Peter** said and became
**disciples** of **Jesus**. They were **baptized** and became part of
the **church** at **Jerusalem**.

Translation Notes:
------------------

-   **

The Disciples Met Together 43-13
==================================


The **disciples** continually listened to the teaching of the
**apostles**, spent time together, ate together, and **prayed** with
each other.  They enjoyed **praising** **God** together and they shared
everything they had with each other. Everyone **thought well of them**.
Every day, more people became **believers**.

*A Bible story from: Acts 2*

Translation Notes:
------------------

-   **thought well of them** - That is, “had a positive opinion of
    them.”
-   *A Bible story from* - These references may be slightly different in
    some Bible translations.

The Crippled Man 44-01
========================


**One day**, **Peter** and **John** were going to the **Temple**. As
they approached the Temple gate, they saw **a crippled man** who was
**begging** for money.

Translation Notes:
------------------

-   **One day** - This phrase introduces an event that happened in the
    past, but does not state the specific time. Many languages have a
    similar way to begin telling a true story.
-   **a crippled man** - This could also be translated as, “a lame
man.”
    This refers to a man who did not have full use of his legs, and
    could not stand or walk.

Get Up and Walk 44-02
=======================


**Peter** looked at the lame man and said, “I do not have any money to
give you. But I will give you what I do have. **In the name of Jesus**,
**get up** and walk!”

Translation Notes:
------------------

-   **In the name of Jesus** - “Name” here stands for the authority
and
    power of the person. Therefore, this expression here means, “by
    the authority of Jesus.”
-   **get up** - That is, “stand up.”

The Crippled Man Was Healed 44-03
===================================


Immediately, **God** **healed** the lame man, and he began to walk and
jump around, and to **praise** God. The people in the **courtyard of
the Temple** were amazed.

Translation Notes:
------------------

-   **courtyard of the Temple** - Only priests could enter the Temple,
    but ordinary Jews were allowed to come into this area that surrounded
    the Temple.

The Power of Jesus 44-04
==========================


A crowd of people quickly came to see the man who was **healed**.
**Peter** said to them, “Why are you amazed that this man is healed? We
did not heal him through our own power or goodness. Rather, it is the
**power** of **Jesus** and the **faith** that Jesus gives that healed
this man.”

Translation Notes:
------------------

-   **

Peter Preached 44-05
======================


“You are the ones who told the **Roman** governor to kill **Jesus**. You
killed the **author of life**, but **God** **raised** him from the
**dead**. Although you did not understand what you were doing, God used
**your actions** to **fulfill** the **prophecies** that the **Messiah**
would **suffer** and die. So now, **repent** and **turn to God** so that
**your sins will be washed away**.”

Translation Notes:
------------------

- -   **author of life** - That is, “the one who created life” or,
“the
    one who gives us life” or, “the one who causes people to live.”
    This refers to Jesus.
-   **your actions** - This can also be translated as, “the things you
    did.” This refers to their asking Pilate to kill Jesus.
-   **turn to God** - That is, “decide to obey God.” -   **your sin
will be washed away** - This could be translated as, “God
    will wash away your sins” or, “God will take away your sins and
    make you clean.” This is talking about God purifying people in
    their spirit by completely removing their sins. It does not mean
    physical washing.

Peter and John Were Arrested 44-06
====================================

lied about Stephen.

Translation Notes:
------------------

-   **One day** - This phrase introduces an event that happened in the

Stephen replied by reminding them of many of the great things **God**
had done from the time of **Abraham** to the time of **Jesus**, and how
God's people continually **disobeyed** him. Then he said, “You stubborn

this**, they **preached** about Jesus everywhere they went.

Translation Notes:

    their coats.” He was probably making sure they didn't get stolen
    or damaged.

    Instead, this caused them to scatter and spread the message even
    more widely.

A **disciple** of **Jesus'** named Philip was one of the **believers** who
fled from **Jerusalem** during the **persecution**. He went to **Samaria**

-   **God created the world** - That is, “God made the world out of
    nothing.”
-   **perfect** - That is, “exactly as it should be” to accomplish all
    that God intended for it.
-   **There was no sin** - For some languages it is not possible to
    express “sin” as a thing, rather it is an action. In those cases
    this could be translated as, “No one ever sinned” or, “People
    did not sin” or, “Nothing evil had happened.”
-   **There was no sickness or death** - That is, “No one got sick and
    no one died” or, “They did not get sick or die.”

Adam and Eve Sinned 48-02
===========================


**Satan** spoke through the snake in **the garden** in order to **deceive
Eve**. Then she and **Adam** **sinned** against **God**. Because they
sinned, everyone on earth gets sick and everyone **dies**.

Translation Notes:
------------------

-   **the garden** - This refers to the garden created by God where he
    placed the first man and woman.
-   **deceive Eve** - That is, “lie to Eve.” Satan lied by leading Eve
    to doubt what God had said. By doing this, he tricked her into
    disobeying God.

Enemies of God 48-03
======================


Because **Adam** and **Eve** **sinned**, something **even more terrible**
happened. They became enemies of **God**. As a result, every person
since then has been born with a sinful nature and is also an enemy
of God. The relationship between God and people was broken by sin.
But God had a plan to restore that relationship.

Translation Notes:
------------------

-   **even more terrible** - That is, “much worse” or, “worse
yet.”

Jesus Will Crush Satan 48-04
==============================


**God** **promised** that one of **Eve's** **descendants** would **crush
Satan's head**, and Satan would **wound his heel**. This meant that Satan
would kill the **Messiah**, but God would **raise him to life again**,
and then the Messiah will crush the power of Satan forever. Many years
later, God revealed that **Jesus** is the Messiah.

Translation Notes:
------------------

-   **crush Satan's head** - This could also be translated as, “step on
    Satan's head and smash it down flat” or, “shatter Satan's head
    by stepping on it.” This is an image of a person stepping on the
    head of a snake. The head is completely crushed, and the snake is
    dead and therefore harmless.
-   **wound his heel** - This is an image of a snake on the ground
    biting a person's foot. In this case, Satan would cause the Messiah
    to suffer, but would not destroy him.
-   **raise him to life again** - That is, “make him alive again.”

A Way of Salvation 48-05
==========================


When **God** destroyed the whole earth by the flood, he provided the
boat to **save** the people who **believed** in him. In the same way,
everyone deserves to be **destroyed because of their sins**, but God
provided **Jesus** to save everyone who believes in him.

Translation Notes:
------------------

-   **destroyed because of their sins** - This could also be translated
    as, “everyone should be punished eternally by God because they
    have sinned.”

The Great High Priest 48-06
=============================


For hundreds of years, **priests** continually offered **sacrifices**
to **God** for people to show the punishment that they deserved for
their **sins**. But those sacrifices could not take away their sin.
**Jesus** is the **Great High Priest**.  Unlike other priests, **he
offered himself** as the only sacrifice that could to take away the sin
of all the people in the world. Jesus was the perfect high priest because
he **took the punishment** for every sin that anyone has ever committed.

Translation Notes:
------------------

-   **he offered himself** - This could also be translated as, “Jesus
    allowed himself to be killed.”
-   **took the punishment** - That is, “received the punishment in his
    own body.”

God's People 48-07
====================


**God** told **Abraham**, “**All the people groups of the earth**
will be **blessed** through you.” **Jesus** was a **descendant**of
Abraham. All the people groups are blessed through him, because everyone
who **believes** in Jesus is **saved** from sin, and becomes **a spiritual
descendant of Abraham**.

Translation Notes:
------------------

-   **all the people groups of the earth** – This could also be
    translated as, “people from all different parts of the world.”
-   **a spiritual descendant of Abraham** - That is, “spiritually
    related to Abraham, and one of God's people.”

The Lamb of God 48-08
=======================


When **God** told **Abraham** to offer his **son**, **Isaac**, as a
**sacrifice**, God provided a **lamb** for the sacrifice **instead of his
son, Isaac**. We all **deserve to die** for our **sins**! But God provided
**Jesus**, the **Lamb of God**, as a sacrifice **to die in our place**.

Translation Notes:
------------------

-   **instead of his son, Isaac** - This can also be translated as, “in
    the place of his son, Isaac” or, “in his son Isaac's place” or,
    “so that he would not have to offer his son Isaac as a sacrifice.”
-   **deserve to die** - That is, “should die.” -   **to die in our
place** - This can also be translated as, “to die in
    the place of each of us” or, “so that he would not have to
    kill us.”

The Passover 48-09
====================


When **God** **sent the last plague on Egypt**, he told each **Israelite**
family to kill **a perfect lamb** and spread **its blood** on the tops
and sides of their **door frames**. When God saw the blood, he **passed
over** their houses and did not kill their firstborn sons. This event
is called the **Passover**.

Translation Notes:
------------------

-   **sent the last plague on Egypt** – That is, “caused the final
    disaster to come on Egypt.” This was the tenth plague when God
    caused the firstborn sons of the Egyptians to die.
-   **a perfect lamb** - That is, “a lamb without any defect.” -
**its blood** - That is, “the lamb's blood.” -   **door frames**
– If door frames are not known, this could be
    translated as, “doors.”
-   **passed over** - This could also be translated as, “passed
by” or,
    “went by.” You may want to connect how this is translated with
    how “Passover” is translated.

The Passover Lamb 48-10
=========================


**Jesus** is **our Passover Lamb**. He was perfect and **sinless**
and was killed at the time of the Passover celebration. When anyone
**believes** in Jesus, the **blood** of Jesus pays for that person’s
**sin**, and **God's punishment passes over that person**.

Translation Notes:
------------------

-   **our Passover Lamb** - That is, “the Passover Lamb that was killed
    for us” or, “the lamb that was killed so that God would pass over
    us” or, “the lamb that was killed so that God would spare us.”
-   **sinless** - This can also be translated as, “had never sinned.”
-   **God's punishment passes over that person** - This statement means,
    “God does not punish that person.” Translate it using a phrase
    that shows its relationship to the words for “Passover” and the
    “Passover Lamb.” If the word “spare” is used in the name of
    the Passover, this could also be translated as, “God spares that
    person from punishment.”

God's New Covenant 48-11
==========================


**God** made a **covenant** with **the Israelites, who were his chosen
people**. But God has now made a **New Covenant** that is available to
everyone. Because of this New Covenant, anyone from any **people group**
can become part of God’s people by **believing** in Jesus.

Translation Notes:
------------------

-   **the Israelites, who were his chosen people** - That is, “the
    Israelites, the people he had chosen” or, “his chosen people,
    the Israelites.”

The Word of God 48-12
=======================


**Moses** was **a great prophet** who proclaimed the **word of God**. But
**Jesus** is **the greatest prophet** of all. He is the Word of God.

Translation Notes:
------------------

-   **a great prophet** - That is, “a very important prophet.” -
**the greatest prophet** - That is, “the most important prophet.” -
**He is the Word of God** - That is, “He is called the Word of God”
    because he reveals God's character. The other prophets preached the
    message God gave them, but Jesus revealed God in his preaching and
    his actions.

A Descendent of David 48-13
=============================


**God** **promised** **King David** that the **Messiah** would be one of
his **descendants**.  **Jesus**, the Messiah, was that special descendant
of David.

Translation Notes:
------------------

-   **

King of the Universe 48-14
============================


**David** was the **king** of **Israel**, but **Jesus** is **the king
of the entire universe**! He will come again and rule his **kingdom**
with **justice** and **peace**, forever.

*A Bible story from: Genesis 1-3, 6, 14, 22; Exodus 12, 20; 2 Samuel 7;
Hebrew 3:1-6, 4:14-5:10, 7:1-8:13, 9:11-10:18; Revelation 21*

Translation Notes:
------------------

-   **the king of the entire universe** - That is, “the king over
    everyone and everything everywhere.”
-   *A Bible story from* - These references may be slightly different in
    some Bible translations.

The Virgin Birth 49-01
========================


An angel told a **virgin** named **Mary** that she would give birth to
**God's Son**. So while she was still a virgin, she gave birth to a son
and named him **Jesus**. Therefore, Jesus is both God and human.

Translation Notes:
------------------

-   **

The Miracles 49-02
====================


**Jesus** did many **miracles** that prove he is **God**. He walked on
water, calmed storms, **healed** many sick people, **drove out demons**,
**raised the dead to life**, and turned five loaves of bread and two
small fish into enough food for over 5,000 people.

Translation Notes:
------------------

-   **drove out demons** - That is, “made demons come out of people.”
-   **raised the dead to life** - This could also be translated as,
    “caused dead people to become alive again.”

Jesus the Teacher 49-03
=========================


**Jesus** was also **a great teacher**, and he spoke with authority
because he is the **Son of God**. He taught that you need to **love**
other people **the same way** you love yourself.

Translation Notes:
------------------

-   **a great teacher** - That is, “a very important teacher” or,
“an
    excellent teacher.”
-   **the same way** - That is, “as much as” or, “the same amount
that”
    or, “to the same degree that.”

Love God Above All 49-04
==========================


He also taught that you need to **love** **God** more than you love
anything else, including **your wealth**.

Translation Notes:
------------------

-   **your wealth** - This could also be translated as, “your
money” or,
    “your possessions.”

The Value of Salvation 49-05
==============================


**Jesus** said that the **kingdom of God** is more valuable than anything
else in the world. The most important thing that you should seek is **to
be saved from your sin** so that you can enter into God's kingdom.

Translation Notes:
------------------

-   **to be saved from your sin** - That is, “to be saved from being
    punished for your sin” or, “that God would save you from your
    sin” or, “to receive salvation from your sin.”

Not All Will Be Saved 49-06
=============================


**Jesus** taught that some people will **receive** him and be **saved**,
but **others will not**. He said that some people are like good soil. They
receive the **good news** of Jesus and are saved. Other people are like
the hard soil of a path, where the **seed of God's word** does not enter
and does not produce any harvest. Those people reject the message about
Jesus and will not enter into **his kingdom**.

Translation Notes:
------------------

-   **others will not** - That is, “other people will not receive him
    and therefore will not be saved.”
-   **seed of God's word** - This can be translated as, “seed, which can
    be compared to God's word.” This phrase makes a comparison between
    seed and God's word.

God Loves Sinners 49-07
=========================


**Jesus** taught that **God** **loves** **sinners** very much. He wants
to **forgive** you and to make you his child.

Translation Notes:
------------------

-   **

God Hates Sin 49-08
=====================


**Jesus** also told us that **God** hates **sin**. When **Adam**
and **Eve** **sinned**, it affected all of their **descendants**.
As a result, every person in the world sins and **is separated from
God**. Therefore, everyone has become an enemy of God.

Translation Notes:
------------------

-   **is separated from God** - This can also be translated as, “cannot
    live with God” or, “cannot be near God” or, “cannot have a
    relationship with God.”

God Gave His Son 49-09
========================


But **God** **loved** everyone in the world so much that he **gave his
only Son** so that **whoever believes in Jesus will not be punished for
his sins, but will live with God forever**.

Translation Notes:
------------------

-   **gave his only Son** - This could also be translated as, “offered
    his only Son to the world as a sacrifice for sins” or, “gave us
    his only Son to be a sacrifice for our sins.”
-   **whoever believes** - This could also be translated as, “anyone who
    believes.”
-   **whoever believes in Jesus will not be punished for his sins, but
    will live with God forever** - This could also be translated as,
    “When anyone believes in Jesus, God will not punish that person
    for his sins, but will allow him to live with God forever.”

Jesus Died in Our Place 49-10
===============================


**Because of your sin**, you are **guilty** and deserve to **die**.
**God should be angry** with you, but he **poured out his anger on**
**Jesus** instead of on you.  When Jesus died on the **cross**, he
**received your punishment**.

Translation Notes:
------------------

-   **Because of your sin** – This can also be translated as, “Because
    you have sinned.” To make it clear that this is talking about
    all people, for some languages it may be more clear to translate
    this as, “Because all people have sinned, they are guilty. They
    deserve death.”
-   **God should be angry** – This can also be translated as,
“It would
    be right for God to be angry.”
-   **poured out his anger on** - That is, “directed his anger at” or,
    “placed all of his anger upon” or, “was angry only with.”
-   **received your punishment** - This could also be translated as,
    “was punished instead of you” or, “was punished for your
    sin.” To make it clear that this applies to everyone, it could
    also be translated as, ”was punished for everyone's sin.”

The Sinless Sacrifice 49-11
=============================


**Jesus** never **sinned**, but he chose to be **punished** and to **die**
as the perfect **sacrifice** to **take away** your sins and the sins of
every person in the world.  Because Jesus sacrificed himself, **God**
can **forgive** any sin, even terrible sins.

Translation Notes:
------------------

-   **take away** - That is, “remove the penalty of” or, “remove the
    punishment for.” The sacrifice of Jesus causes God to look at our
    sin as if it never existed.

Jesus Died and Rose Again 49-12
=================================


**Good works cannot save you**. There is nothing you can do to have a
relationship with **God**. Only **Jesus** can **wash away your sins**. You
must **believe** that Jesus is the **Son of God**, that he **died** on the
**cross** **instead of you**, and that God **raised him to life again**.

Translation Notes:
------------------

-   **Good works cannot save you** - That is, “Doing good things cannot
    save you from your sins” or, “You cannot do anything good enough
    to save yourself from the penalty for your sins.”
-   **wash away your sins** - That is, “completely remove your
sins” or,
    “take away your sins and make you clean.” This is talking
    about God purifying people in their spirit by completely removing
    their sins.  It does not mean physical washing.
-   **instead of you** – That is, “ in your place.” -   **raised
him to life again** - This could also be translated as,
    “made him alive again.”

God Loves You 49-13
=====================


**God** will **save** everyone who **believes** in **Jesus** and
**receives** him as their **Master**. But he will not save anyone who
does not believe in him. It does not matter if you are rich or poor, man
or woman, old or young, or where you live. God **loves** you and wants
you to believe in Jesus so **he can have a close relationship with you**.

Translation Notes:
------------------

-   **he can have a close relationship with you** - This can also be
    translated as, “so that you can be his child” or, “so that
    you can be his friend” or, “so you can belong to him.”

Believe in Jesus 49-14
========================


**Jesus** invites you to **believe in him** and to **be baptized**. Do you
**believe that** Jesus is the **Messiah**, the only **Son of God**? Do
you believe that you are a **sinner** and that you deserve for **God**
to **punish** you? Do you believe that Jesus **died** on the **cross**
to **take away** your sins?

Translation Notes:
------------------

-   **believe in him** - This can also be translated as, “trust
in him”
    or, “trust in him to save you” or, “entrust your whole life
    to him.”
-   **be baptized** - This could also be translated as, “have someone
    baptize you” or, “let them baptize you.”
-   **believe that** - This can also be translated as, “acknowledge
    that” or, “agree that.”
-   **take away** - See note on

God's Kingdom of Light 49-15
==============================


If you **believe** in **Jesus** and what he has done for you, you
are a **Christian**!  **God** has taken you out of **Satan's kingdom
of darkness** and put you into **God’s kingdom of light**. God has
taken away your old, sinful ways of doing things and has given you new,
righteous ways of doing things.

Translation Notes:
------------------

-   **Satan's kingdom of darkness** - “Darkness” is used here to refer
    to sin and everything that is evil. This could be translated as,
    “Satan's evil rule over people, which is like darkness.”
-   **God's kingdom of light** - “Light” here refers to God's holiness
    and goodness. This could be translated as, “God's righteous rule
    over people, which is like light.” The Bible often compares evil
    to darkness, and goodness to light.

Sins Are Forgiven 49-16
=========================


If you are a **Christian**, **God** has **forgiven** your **sins**
because of what **Jesus** did. Now, God **considers you to be** a close
friend instead of an enemy.

Translation Notes:
------------------

-   **considers you to be** - That is, “thinks of you as” or,
“regards
    you as” or, “calls you.”

Follow Jesus' Teachings 49-17
===============================


If you are a friend of **God** and a **servant** of **Jesus** the
**Master**, you will want to **obey** what Jesus teaches you. Even though
you are a **Christian**, you will still **be tempted to sin**. But God
**is faithful** and says that if you **confess your sins**, he will
**forgive** you. **He will give you strength to fight against sin**.

Translation Notes:
------------------

-   **be tempted to sin** - That is, ““be tempted to sin even
though you
    know sin is wrong.”
-   **is faithful** - In this context this means that God, “keeps his
    promises.”
-   **confess your sins** - This could be translated as, “admit to God
    what you have done wrong.”
-   **He will give you strength to fight against sin** - That is, “He
    will give you spiritual strength to refuse to sin.”

Grow as a Christian 49-18
===========================


**God** tells you to **pray**, to study **his word**, to **worship**
him with other **Christians**, and to tell others what he has done
for you. All of these things help you **to have a deeper relationship
with him**.

*A Bible story from: Romans 3:21-26, 5:1-11; John 3:16; Mark 16:16;
Colossians 1:13-14; 2 Corinthians 5:17-21; 1 John 1:5-10*

Translation Notes:
------------------

-   **to have a deeper relationship with him** - This could also be
    translated as, “to love him more” or, “to know him more” or,
    “to become more faithful to him.”
-   *A Bible story from* - These references may be slightly different in
    some Bible translations.

The Church Is Growing 50-01
=============================


For almost 2,000 years, more and more people around the world have been
hearing the **good news** about **Jesus** the **Messiah**. **The Church
has been growing**.  Jesus **promised** he would return **at the end of
the world**. Though he has not yet come back, he will keep his promise.

Translation Notes:
------------------

-   **The Church has been growing** - This could also be translated as,
    “The number of people in the Church around the world has been
    increasing” or, “The number of believers in Jesus has been
    increasing.”
-   **at the end of the world** - This phrase means, “right before the
    present world comes to an end” or, “in the final days of this
    world.”

The Good News 50-02
=====================


As we wait for **Jesus** to return, **God** wants us to live in a way
that is **holy** and that honors him. He also wants us to tell others
about his **kingdom**.  When Jesus was living on earth he said, “My
**disciples** will **preach** the **good news** about the kingdom of
God to people everywhere in the world, and then **the end will come**.”

Translation Notes:
------------------

-   **the end will come** - This could be translated as, “the end of
    this world will come” or, “the end of this world will happen”
    or, “this present world will end.”

The Fields Are Ripe 50-03
===========================


Many **people groups** still have not heard about **Jesus**. Before
he returned to **heaven**, Jesus told **Christians** to proclaim the
**good news** to people who have never heard it. He said, “Go and
**make disciples** of all people groups!” and, “**The fields are
ripe for harvest**!”

Translation Notes:
------------------

-   **make disciples** - This has the meaning, “help people to become my
    disciples.”
-   **The fields are ripe for harvest** - This could also be translated
    as, “They are ready to be brought to God like fields that are ripe
    for harvest” or, “They are ready to be gathered and brought to
    God like fields whose crops are ripe and ready to be gathered.”
-   **The fields** - In this expression, “The fields” represents the
    people in the world.
-   **ripe** - “Ripe” here represents being ready to believe in Jesus.
-   **harvest** - “Harvest” here represents the work of bringing
people
    to God by teaching them about Jesus.

Remain Faithful 50-04
=======================


**Jesus** also said, “A **servant** is **not greater than** his
**master**.  Just as the authorities of this world have hated me, they
will torture and kill you **because of me**. Although **in this world**
you will **suffer**, be encouraged because I have defeated **Satan**,
the one who rules this world. If you **remain faithful to me** **to the
end**, then **God will save you**!”

Translation Notes:
------------------

-   **not greater than** - That is, “not more important than” or, in
    this case, “not treated better than.”
-   **because of me** - That is, “because you obey me” or,
“because you
    teach people about me” or, “because you belong to me.”
-   **in this world** - This could also be translated as, “in this
    lifetime.”
-   **remain faithful to me** - That is, “Keep obeying me.” -   **to
the end** - That is, “to the end of your life.” -   **will save you**
- This refers to spiritual salvation rather than
    physical deliverance from harm. It has already been stated that many
    believers will be killed or tortured.

The Enemy 50-05
=================


**Jesus** told his **disciples** a story to explain what will happen
to people when the world ends. He said, “A man planted **good seed**
in his field. While he was sleeping, his enemy came and planted **weed
seeds** along with the **wheat**, and then he went away.”

Translation Notes:
------------------

-   **good seed** – This seed was wheat grain. If this type of seed is
    not known in your language area, it is best to use a general term
    for “seed.” If there is no general term, it may be necessary
    to choose a type of grain seed that is known and say, for example,
    “good seed like rice.”
-   **weed seeds** - The weed seeds that were planted would grow up as
    tall grass but could not be eaten. They were useless.
-   **wheat** – That is, “wheat seeds.” Wheat is a kind of
grain that
    grows like a tall grass. It has seeds that people use for food.

The Weeds 50-06
=================


“When the plants sprouted, the **servants** of the man said,
‘**Master**, you planted **good** seed in that field.  So why are
there weeds in it?’ The master answered, ‘**An enemy must have
planted them**.’”

Translation Notes:
------------------

- -   **An enemy must have planted them** - If possible, translate this in
    a way that indicates that the speaker did not see this happen.

Wait for the Harvest 50-07
============================


“The **servants** responded to their **master**, ‘Should we pull
out the weeds?’ The master said, ‘No. If you do that, **you will
pull out some of the wheat as well**. Wait **until the harvest** and
then gather the weeds into piles to be burned, but bring **the wheat**
into my **barn**.’”

Translation Notes:
------------------

- -   **you will pull out some of the wheat as well** - That is,
“you will
    accidentally pull out some of the wheat also.” It would be too
    difficult to distinguish young wheat from the weeds, and to pull
    the weeds without uprooting the wheat.
-   **until the harvest** - That is, “until the time when the wheat is
    ready to harvest” or, “until the wheat has grown enough to
    be harvested.”
-   **the wheat** – That is, “the harvested wheat grains.” -
**barn** - This refers to the building where the harvested wheat
    grain was saved and stored. It could also be called a
    “storehouse.”

The Field Is the World 50-08
==============================


The **disciples** did not understand the meaning of the story, so they
asked **Jesus** to explain it to them. Jesus said, “The man who planted
the **good** seed represents the **Messiah**. The field represents the
world. The good seed represents **the people of God’s kingdom**.”

Translation Notes:
------------------

-   **the people of God's kingdom** - This can also be translated as,
    “the people who live under God's authority” or, “the people
    who have submitted to God's rule” or, “the people who will live
    with God in his Kingdom.”

The Enemy Is the Devil 50-09
==============================


“The weeds represent the people **who belong to the evil one**. The
enemy who planted the weeds represents **the devil**. The harvest
**represents the end of the world**, and **the harvesters** represent
**God's** **angels**.”
