30. Jesus Feeds Five Thousand People
====================================

Overview:
---------

Jesus went with his disciples to a quiet place to rest, but many people
followed them. So he taught them and healed their sick. When they became
hungry, there were only two loaves of bread and two fish for five thousand
people. However, Jesus blessed the food and told his disciples to give
it to the people. Everyone had enough to eat, and there was even food
left over.
