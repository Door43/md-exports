5. The Son of Promise
=====================

Overview:
---------

God kept his promise to Abram. He enabled his wife, Sarai, to have a son,
Isaac, when they were very old. God changed their names to Abraham and
Sarah, and told Abraham to circumcise all the males in his household as an
act of worship. God also tested Abraham's faith by asking him to sacrifice
Isaac. Because Abraham was willing to obey, God promised again to make
him a great nation and to bless all the families of the world through him.
