16. The Deliverers
==================

Overview:
---------

The Israelites did not destroy the Canaanites as God commanded. Instead,
they worshiped Canaanite idols. Therefore, God sent enemies against
Israel to turn them back to him. He also sent deliverers to rescue them.
For example, Gideon delivered Israel from Midian. But afterwards, Israel
served idols again. This cycle of sin and deliverance was repeated
many times. Finally, Israel rejected God and asked for a king like the
other nations.
