37. Jesus Raises Lazarus from the Dead
======================================

Overview:
---------

Lazarus, a good friend of Jesus, was sick, but Jesus waited until he
died before he went to visit. Jesus told Lazarusâ€™ sisters, Mary and
Martha to believe in him, and to open the tomb where Lazarus was buried.
He prayed and called to Lazarus to come out alive. Many people believed
in Jesus because of this miracle. But the religious leaders were jealous
and planned to kill him.
