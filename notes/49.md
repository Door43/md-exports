49. God's New Covenant
======================

Overview:
---------

Jesus is both God and man. He was born of a virgin, and did many
miracles. He taught us that we are sinners, but that God wants to forgive
our sin. Jesus died in our place and rose again from the dead.  If we
believe in Jesus, we are his friends. He wants us to pray, study his Word,
worship with other Christians, and tell everyone what he has done for us.
