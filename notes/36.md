36. The Transfiguration
=======================

Overview:
---------

Jesus took Peter, James and John up a high mountain. While Jesus was
praying there, his face and clothes became to shine. Moses and Elijah
appeared and talked to Jesus about his death. The disciples were amazed
when they saw this. Then a voice from heaven said “This is my Son whom
I love.” But Jesus told them not to tell anyone what happened until
after he was raised from the dead.
