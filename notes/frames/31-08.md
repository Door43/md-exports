The Son of God 31-08
======================


**When Peter and Jesus got into the boat, the wind** immediately stopped
blowing and the water became calm. The **disciples** were amazed. They
**worshiped** Jesus, saying to him, “**Truly, you are the Son of
God**.”

*A Bible story from: Matthew 14:22-33; Mark 6:45-52; John 6:16-21*

Translation Notes:
------------------

-   **When Peter and Jesus got into the boat, the wind** – It may be
    better to say, “Peter and Jesus got into the boat, and then the
    wind.”
-   **worshiped Jesus** – This could be translated as, “bowed down and
    worshiped Jesus.” This word has the idea of physically bowing down
    in front of someone out of respect and reverence.
-   **Truly you are the Son of God** – Other ways to say this would be,
    “You really are the Son of God” or, “It really is true that
    you are the Son of God.”
-   *A Bible story from* - These references may be slightly different in
    some Bible translations.
