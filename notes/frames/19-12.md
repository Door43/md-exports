Killing the Prophets of Baal 19-12
====================================


Then **Elijah** said, “Do not let any of the **prophets** of **Baal
escape**!” So the people **captured** the prophets of Baal. Then Elijah
took them away from there and killed them.

Translation Notes:
------------------

-   **escape** - The prophets of Baal tried to run away after their god
    was proven to be a false god.
-   **captured** – That is, “seized and held onto” or, “took
hold of.”
