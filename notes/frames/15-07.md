The Gibeonites in Danger 15-07
================================


The **Israelites** were angry when they found out that the **Gibeonites**
had deceived them, but they kept the **peace** treaty they had made with
them because it was a **promise** before **God**. Some time later, the
**kings** of another people group in **Canaan**, the **Amorites**, heard
that the Gibeonites had made a peace treaty with the Israelites, so they
combined their armies into one large army and attacked **Gibeon**. The
Gibeonites **sent a message to Joshua asking for help**.

Translation Notes:
------------------

-   **sent a message to Joshua asking for help** - This could be
    translated as, “sent some of their people to tell Joshua that they
    needed the Israelites to help defend them against their enemies.”
