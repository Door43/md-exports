The Value of Salvation 49-05
==============================


**Jesus** said that the **kingdom of God** is more valuable than anything
else in the world. The most important thing that you should seek is **to
be saved from your sin** so that you can enter into God's kingdom.

Translation Notes:
------------------

-   **to be saved from your sin** - That is, “to be saved from being
    punished for your sin” or, “that God would save you from your
    sin” or, “to receive salvation from your sin.”
