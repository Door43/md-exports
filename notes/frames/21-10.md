Messiah Will Heal 21-10
=========================


The **prophet** **Isaiah** said the Messiah would live in **Galilee**,
comfort **broken-hearted people**, and **proclaim freedom to captives**
and **release to prisoners**. He also predicted that the **Messiah**
would **heal** sick people and those who **could not hear, see, speak,
or walk**.

Translation Notes:
------------------

-   **broken-hearted people** - This expression refers to people who are
    experiencing extreme sadness.
-   **proclaim freedom to captives** - That is, “tell slaves they could
    be free.” This could also refer to freeing people from slavery
    to sin.
-   **release to prisoners** - That is, “he will set free those who have
    unjustly been put into prison.” This could also refer to setting
    people free from the bondage of sin.
-   **could not hear, see, speak, or walk** – It may be better to say,
    “could not hear, could not see, could not speak, or could not
    walk.” Some languages have special words for these conditions,
    such as “deaf” and “blind.”
