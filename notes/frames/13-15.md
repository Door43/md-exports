Moses Prayed for Israel 13-15
===============================


**Moses** climbed the mountain again and **prayed** that **God**
would **forgive** the people.  God **listened to** Moses and forgave
them. **Moses wrote** the **Ten Commandments** on new stone tablets to
replace the ones he had broken. Then God led the **Israelites** away
from **Mount Sinai** toward the **Promised Land**.

*A Bible story from: Exodus 19-34*
