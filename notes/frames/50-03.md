The Fields Are Ripe 50-03
===========================


Many **people groups** still have not heard about **Jesus**. Before
he returned to **heaven**, Jesus told **Christians** to proclaim the
**good news** to people who have never heard it. He said, “Go and
**make disciples** of all people groups!” and, “**The fields are
ripe for harvest**!”

    disciples.”

    people in the world.
-   **ripe** - “Ripe” here represents being ready to believe in Jesus.
-   **harvest** - “Harvest” here represents the work of bringing
