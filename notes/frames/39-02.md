The False Witnesses 39-02
===========================


Inside the house, the **Jewish leaders** **put Jesus on trial**. They
brought many false **witnesses** who **lied about him**. However, **their
statements did not agree with each other**, so the Jewish leaders could
not prove **he was guilty of anything**. Jesus did not say anything.

Translation Notes:
------------------

-   **put Jesus on trial** – This could be translated as, “had
a formal
    meeting to accuse Jesus of doing something wrong.” Usually a
    trial is done to find out if someone is innocent or guilty of a
    certain crime. In this case, the leaders were determined to make
    Jesus seem guilty.
-   **lied about him** - That is, “told lies about him” or, “falsely
    accused him of doing something wrong.”
-   **their statements did not agree with each other** - This could be
    translated as, “they said things about Jesus that were very
    different from each other” or, “the witnesses said things about
    Jesus that contradicted each other.”
-   **he was guilty of anything** – That is, “that he had done
anything
    wrong.”
