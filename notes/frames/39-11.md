He Is Not Guilty 39-11
========================


After speaking with **Jesus**, **Pilate** went out to the crowd and
said, “**I find no guilt in this man**.” But the **Jewish leaders**
and the crowd shouted, “**Crucify** him!” Pilate replied, “**He
is not guilty**.” But they shouted even louder.  Then Pilate said a
third time, “He is not guilty!”

Translation Notes:
------------------

-   **I find no guilt in this man** - That is, “I do not find this man
    to be guilty” or, “I have examined this man, and I do not see
    that he has done anything wrong.”
-   **He is not guilty** - That is, “He has done nothing wrong!”
