Jesus Prayed Alone 31-01
==========================


Then **Jesus** told the **disciples** to get into the boat and sail to the
other side of the lake while **he dismissed the crowd**. After Jesus had
sent the crowd away, he went up on a **mountainside** to **pray**. Jesus
was there all alone, and he prayed until late at night.

Translation Notes:
------------------

-   **he dismissed the crowd** - This is another way of saying, “he sent
    the crowd on their way” or, “he told the crowd of people to go
    back to their homes.”
-   **mountainside** - That is, “the side of a mountain.”
