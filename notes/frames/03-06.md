The Animals Came 03-06
========================


**God sent** a male and a female of every animal and bird to **Noah**
so they could go into the boat and be kept safe during the flood. God
sent seven males and seven females of every type of animal that could be
**used for sacrifices**. When they were all in the boat, **God himself
closed the door**.

Translation Notes:
------------------

-   **God sent** - Noah did not need to find the animals. God sent them
    to him.
-   **used for sacrifices** - For some languages it may be better to say
    something like, “animals that were acceptable to sacrifice to
    God.” God had decided that people should sacrifice animals to him,
    but he only permitted them to sacrifice certain kinds of animals.
-   **God himself closed the door** - This emphasizes that it was God
    who shut the door.
