John the Prophet 24-01
========================


**John**, the son of **Zechariah** and Elizabeth, grew up and became
a **prophet**. He lived in the **wilderness**, ate **wild honey** and
**locusts**, and wore **clothes made from camel hair**.

Translation Notes:
------------------

-   **wilderness** - That is, “the desert” or, “a remote,
desert-like
    place.” There were few people living out in this area.
-   **wild honey** - This honey was the natural product of bees in the
    wilderness; it was not cultivated by people. If that is what people
    would understand by the word “honey,” you may not need to call
    it “wild.”
-   **locusts** - These were large, hopping insects with wings, like
    very large grasshoppers. Some people who live in the desert eat them.
-   **camel hair** - A camel is an animal that has very rough hair.
    People could make clothing out of it. This could be translated as
    “rough animal hair.”
-   **clothes made from camel hair** - That is, “coarse clothes made of
    camel hair.” These clothes would not quickly wear out in the
    wilderness as other clothes would.
