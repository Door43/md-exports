Repent and Be Baptized 43-11
==============================


**Peter** answered them, “Every one of you should **repent** and be
**baptized** **in the name of** **Jesus Christ** so that **God** will
**forgive** your **sins**. Then he will also give you the **gift of the
Holy Spirit**.”

Translation Notes:
------------------

-   **in the name of** - This phrase means both, “by the authority of”
    and, “under the authority of.” Consider translating the word
    “name” literally if it will be understood in this way in your
    language.
-   **Christ** – This is the same meaning as “Messiah.” It could be
    translated as “Anointed One” or, “Chosen One.” Instead of
    translating the meaning, some translators may choose to keep the
    word “Christ” and spell it using the sounds in their own language.
-   **Jesus Christ** – Since “Christ” is a title here, some
translators
    may choose to change the order and say, “Christ Jesus.” Both
    orders are used in the Bible.
