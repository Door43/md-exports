Assyria Destroyed Israel 20-02
================================


So **God** **punished both kingdoms** by allowing their enemies to destroy
them. The **Assyrian Empire**, a powerful, cruel nation, destroyed the
**kingdom of Israel**.  The Assyrians killed many people in the kingdom of
Israel, **took away** everything of value, and burned much of the country.

Translation Notes:
------------------

-   **both kingdoms** - This refers to both the kingdoms of Israel and
    Judah.
-   **Empire** - A country was called an “empire” when it was powerful
    enough to extend its authority over many other countries.
-   **took away** - That is, “stole.” They stole these valuable things
    and carried them back to Assyria.
