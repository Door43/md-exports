The Seed in Good Soil 33-05
=============================


“Other seeds fell into **good soil**. These seeds grew up and produced
30, 60, or even 100 times as much grain as the seed that had been
planted. **He who has ears, let him hear!**”

Translation Notes:
------------------

- -   **good soil** – That is, “fertile soil” or, “soil that
was good for
    growing plants.”
-   **He who has ears, let him hear!** - This saying means, “Everyone
    who hears what I am saying should listen to me carefully” or,
    “If anyone hears what I have said, he should pay attention to what
    I mean.” This can also be translated as a command. “Since you
    have ears to hear, listen carefully to what I am saying.”
