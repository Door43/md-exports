God Will Judge Satan 50-15
============================


When **Jesus** returns, he will completely destroy **Satan** and **his
kingdom**. He will throw Satan into **hell** where he will burn forever,
along with everyone who chose to follow him rather than to **obey**
**God**.

Translation Notes:
------------------

-   **his kingdom** - This could also be translated as, “Satan's evil
    rule over people” or, “all the evil things he does and the evil
    people he controls.”
-   **rather than** - That is, “instead of.”
