The Sick Woman 32-13
======================


**Jesus** returned to the other side of the lake. After he arrived there,
a large crowd gathered around him and **pressed in on him**. In the
crowd was a woman who had suffered from a bleeding problem for twelve
years. She had paid all of her money to doctors so they would **heal**
her, but **she only got worse**.

Translation Notes:
------------------

-   **pressed in on him** - That is, “pushed tightly against him” or,
    “crowded in tightly around him.”
-   **she only got worse** - That is, “her condition only got
worse” or,
    ” her health got worse instead of better” or, “instead she
    became more sick.”
