Elijah Challenged Ahab 19-05
==============================


After three and a half years, **God** told **Elijah** to return
to the **kingdom of Israel** and **speak with Ahab because he was
going to send** rain again. When Ahab saw Elijah he said, “There
you are, **you troublemaker**!” Elijah replied to him, “You are
the troublemaker! **You have abandoned Yahweh**, the true God, and
**worshiped** **Baal**. Bring all the people of the kingdom of Israel
to **Mount Carmel**.”

    was doing wrong and also by stopping the rain.

    worshiping and obeying Yahweh.
