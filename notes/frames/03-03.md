The Big Boat 03-03
====================


**God** told **Noah** to make **the boat** about 140 meters long, 23
meters wide, and 13.5 meters high. Noah was to build it with wood and to
make three levels, many rooms, a roof, and a window. The boat would keep
Noah, his family, and every kind of land animal safe during the flood.

Translation Notes:
------------------

-   **the boat** - The boat was big enough to carry eight people, two of
    every kind of animal, and their provisions for almost a year.
