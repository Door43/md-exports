What Is Our Reward? 28-09
===========================


**Peter** said to **Jesus**, “We have **left everything** and followed
you. **What will be our reward?**”

Translation Notes:
------------------

-   **left everything** - That is, “left everything behind” or,
“given
    up everything we owned.”
-   **What will be our reward?** - Another way to say this is, “What
    reward will we receive” or, “How will we be rewarded?” or,
    “What will God give us as a reward?” It may also be necessary
    to add, “because we have done this?”
