They Mocked Jesus 39-05
=========================


The **Jewish leaders** all answered the **high priest**, “He deserves
to **die**!” Then **they blindfolded Jesus**, **spit on him**, hit him,
and **mocked** him.

Translation Notes:
------------------

-   **they blindfolded Jesus** - That is. “they covered Jesus' eyes so
    that he could not see.”
-   **spit on him** - This could also be translated as, “spit on him to
    insult him” or, “spit on him in order to say that he was
    worthless.” This was a way of showing contempt for someone.
