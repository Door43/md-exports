The Passover 48-09
====================


When **God** **sent the last plague on Egypt**, he told each **Israelite**
family to kill **a perfect lamb** and spread **its blood** on the tops
and sides of their **door frames**. When God saw the blood, he **passed
over** their houses and did not kill their firstborn sons. This event
is called the **Passover**.

Translation Notes:
------------------

-   **sent the last plague on Egypt** – That is, “caused the final
    disaster to come on Egypt.” This was the tenth plague when God
    caused the firstborn sons of the Egyptians to die.
-   **a perfect lamb** - That is, “a lamb without any defect.” -
**its blood** - That is, “the lamb's blood.” -   **door frames**
– If door frames are not known, this could be
    translated as, “doors.”
-   **passed over** - This could also be translated as, “passed
by” or,
    “went by.” You may want to connect how this is translated with
    how “Passover” is translated.
