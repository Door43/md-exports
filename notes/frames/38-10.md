Peter's Promise 38-10
=======================


**Peter** then said to **Jesus**, “Even if I must **die**, I will
never **deny you**!” All the other **disciples** said the same thing.

Translation Notes:
------------------

-   **deny you** - That is, “deny that I know you” or, “deny that
I am
    your disciple” or, “disown you.”
