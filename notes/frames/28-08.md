All Things Are Possible 28-08
===============================


**Jesus** looked at the **disciples** and said, “**With people this
is impossible**, but **with God, all things are possible**.”

Translation Notes:
------------------

-   **With people this is impossible** - That is, “It is not possible
    for people to do this” or, “Mere humans cannot save themselves.”
-   **with God, all things are possible** - This could also be
    translated as, “God is able to do anything, even save a rich
    person” or, “God is able to do impossible things, so he can save
    even a rich person.”
