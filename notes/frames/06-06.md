Two Nations 06-06
===================


**God** told **Rebekah**, “Two nations will come **from the two sons**
inside of you. **They will struggle with each other** and **the older
son** will **serve the younger one**.”

Translation Notes:
------------------

-   **from the two sons** - That is, “from the descendants of the two
    sons.”
-   **They will struggle with each other** - Both the two sons and the
    nations that will come from them will continually fight with each
    other. Compare to
-   **the older son** - Even though the babies were twins, the baby that
    came out first would be treated as the older son.
-   **serve the younger one** – This could be translated as, “the
older
    son will have to do what the younger one tells him to do.”
