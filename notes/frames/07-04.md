Isaac Blessed Jacob 07-04
===========================


**Jacob came to Isaac** and said, “I am **Esau**. I have come so that
you can **bless** me.” When Isaac felt the goat hair and smelled the
clothes, **he thought it was Esau** and blessed him.

-   **Jacob came to Isaac** - In some languages it might be more natural
    to say, “Jacob went to Isaac.”

    touching and smelling was Esau.
