Peter Sank 31-07
==================


Then **Peter** became afraid and began to sink in the water. He cried
out, “**Master** , **save** me!” **Jesus** reached out right away
and grabbed him. Then he said to Peter, “**You man of little faith**,
**why did you doubt**?”

Translation Notes:
------------------

-   **You man of little faith** - This may also be translated as, “You
    have so little faith in me!” or, “You do not trust me very
    much!”
-   **why did you doubt?** - That is, “You should not have doubted
me!”
    or, “You should have trusted me completely.” This isn't a real
    question, but a way in this language to make a strong point. In many
    languages, it works better to express this as a statement.
