Jesus Opened their Minds 42-07
================================


**Jesus** said, “I told you that everything written about me in
**God’s word** must be **fulfilled**.” Then he **opened their minds
so that they could understand** God’s word. He said, “It was written
long ago that the **Messiah** would **suffer**, **die**, and **rise**
from the dead **on the third day**.”
