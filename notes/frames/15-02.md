Crossing the Jordan River 15-02
=================================


The **Israelites** had to cross the **Jordan River** to enter into the
**Promised Land**.  **God** told **Joshua**, “**Have the priests go
first**.” When the priests started to step into the Jordan River,
**the water upstream stopped flowing** so the Israelites could cross
over to the other side of the river on dry ground.

Translation Notes:
------------------

-   **Have the priests go first** – For some languages it may be helpful
    to add, “Have the priests go before the rest of the people to
    cross the river.”
-   **the water upstream stopped flowing** — In some languages it may be
    helpful to add, “and the water in front of them flowed away
    downstream.”
