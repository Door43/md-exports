We Will Meet Jesus in the Sky 50-12
=====================================


Then the **Christians** who are **still alive** will rise up into the sky
and join with the other Christians who **rose** from the **dead**. They
will all be with **Jesus** there. After that, Jesus will live with his
people in **perfect** peace and unity forever.

Translation Notes:
