Joshua Renewed the Covenant 15-13
===================================


**When Joshua was an old man**, he called all the people of **Israel**
together. Then Joshua reminded the people of their obligation to
**obey** the **covenant** that **God** had made with the **Israelites**
at **Sinai**. The people **promised** to **remain faithful to God**
and **follow his laws**.

*A Bible story from: Joshua 1-24*

Translation Notes:
------------------

-   **When Joshua was an old man** – It may be clearer to say, “Many
    years later, when Joshua was an old man.” Joshua was over 100
    years old at this time.
-   **remain faithful to God** - In other words, they would be loyal to
    God. They would worship and serve only God; they would not worship
    or serve any other gods.
-   **follow his laws** - This means that the people would obey the laws
    that God had given them already as part of the covenant.
-   *A Bible story from* - These references may be slightly different in
    some Bible translations.
