The Ministry of Elisha 26-06
==============================


**Jesus** continued saying, “And during the time of the **prophet**
**Elisha**, there were many people in **Israel** with skin diseases. But
Elisha did not **heal** any of them. He only healed the skin disease
of **Naaman**, **a commander** of Israel’s enemies.” The people who
were listening to Jesus were **Jews**. So when they heard him say this,
**they were furious at him**.

Translation Notes:
------------------

-   **Elisha** - Elisha was God's prophet who came after Elijah. Like
    Elijah, Elisha confronted Israelite kings who were sinning against
    God and he did miracles that God gave him power to do.
-   **a commander** – That is, “a military leader.” -   **they
were furious at him** - The Jews did not want to hear that
    God had blessed any people group besides themselves, so they were
    very angry at what Jesus said.
