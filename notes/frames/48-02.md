Adam and Eve Sinned 48-02
===========================


**Satan** spoke through the snake in **the garden** in order to **deceive
Eve**. Then she and **Adam** **sinned** against **God**. Because they
sinned, everyone on earth gets sick and everyone **dies**.

Translation Notes:
------------------

-   **the garden** - This refers to the garden created by God where he
    placed the first man and woman.
-   **deceive Eve** - That is, “lie to Eve.” Satan lied by leading Eve
    to doubt what God had said. By doing this, he tricked her into
    disobeying God.
