The Betrayer 38-06
====================


Then **Jesus** said to the **disciples**, “One of you will **betray**
me.” The disciples were shocked, and asked who would do such a
thing. Jesus said, “The person to whom I give this piece of bread **is
the betrayer**.” Then he gave the bread to **Judas**.

Translation Notes:
------------------

-   **give this piece of bread** – That is, “hand this piece of
bread.” -   **is the betrayer** - This could also be translated as,
“will betray
    me” or, “is the one who will betray me.”
