Jesus Will Crush Satan 48-04
==============================


**God** **promised** that one of **Eve's** **descendants** would **crush
Satan's head**, and Satan would **wound his heel**. This meant that Satan
would kill the **Messiah**, but God would **raise him to life again**,
and then the Messiah will crush the power of Satan forever. Many years
later, God revealed that **Jesus** is the Messiah.

Translation Notes:
------------------

-   **crush Satan's head** - This could also be translated as, “step on
    Satan's head and smash it down flat” or, “shatter Satan's head
    by stepping on it.” This is an image of a person stepping on the
    head of a snake. The head is completely crushed, and the snake is
    dead and therefore harmless.
-   **wound his heel** - This is an image of a snake on the ground
    biting a person's foot. In this case, Satan would cause the Messiah
    to suffer, but would not destroy him.
-   **raise him to life again** - That is, “make him alive again.”
