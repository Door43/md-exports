You Are My Beloved Son 24-08
==============================


When **Jesus** came up out of the water after being **baptized**, the
**Spirit of God appeared in the form of a dove** and came down and rested
on him. At the same time, God's voice spoke from **heaven**, saying,
“You are **my Son whom I love**, and I am very pleased with you.”

Translation Notes:
------------------

-   **my Son whom I love** - Make sure the translation of this does not
    sound like there was another son. It may be necessary to say, “You
    are my Son. I love you very much and am very pleased with you.”
