An Annual Feast 12-14
=======================


**God** commanded the **Israelites** to celebrate **the Passover**
every year in order to **remember how God gave them victory over** the
**Egyptians** and rescued them from being **slaves**. They celebrated
by killing a **perfect lamb**, eating it with **unleavened bread**.

*A Bible story from: Exodus 12:33-15:21*

Translation Notes:
------------------

-   **the Passover** - This could be translated as, “the Passover
    activities” or, “the Passover celebration” or, “the Passover
    meal.”
-   **remember how God gave them victory over** – This could be
    translated as, “regularly remind themselves of how God defeated.”
    The word “remember” here doesn't just mean to not forget; it
    also means to formally commemorate something.
-   **perfect lamb** - The word “perfect” here refers to a lamb
with no
    disease or anything else wrong with it. Another way to say this
    might be, “a completely healthy and well-formed lamb.”
-   **unleavened bread** - This is another way to say, “bread that was
    made without yeast.”
-   *A Bible story from* - These references may be slightly different in
    some Bible translations.
