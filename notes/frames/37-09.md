Jesus' Prayer 37-09
=====================


Then **Jesus** looked up to **heaven** and said, “**Father**, thank you
for **hearing me**. I know you always listen to me, but I say this for
the sake of all these people standing here, so that they will **believe**
you sent me.” Then Jesus shouted, “**Lazarus**, **come out**!”

Translation Notes:
------------------

-   **hearing me** – That is, “listening to me.” It may be
helpful to
    add, “as I pray to you” or, “when I talk to you.”
-   **come out** - Some languages may prefer to say, “come out of the
    tomb.”
