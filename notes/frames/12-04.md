Pharaoh Chased Israel 12-04
=============================


So **Pharaoh** and his army chased after the **Israelites** to **make
them their slaves again**. When the Israelites saw the **Egyptian**
army coming, they realized **they were trapped between Pharaoh's army
and the Red Sea**. They were very afraid and cried out, “**Why did we
leave Egypt**? We are going to die!”

Translation Notes:
------------------

-   **they were trapped between…Red Sea** - Another way to say this
    would be, “there was nowhere they could go to escape since the
    Egyptians were behind them and the Red Sea was in front of them.”
-   **Why did we leave Egypt?** – This means, “We should not have left
    Egypt!” They were not really asking for reasons. Because they were
    afraid, in this moment they were wishing they had not left Egypt .
