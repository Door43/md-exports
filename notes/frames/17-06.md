David Wanted to Build a Temple 17-06
======================================


**David** wanted to **build a temple** where all the **Israelites**
could **worship** **God** and offer him **sacrifices**. For about 400
years, the people had been worshiping God and offering sacrifices to
him at the **Tent of Meeting** that **Moses** had built.

Translation Notes:
------------------

-   **build a temple** - David wanted to construct a permanent building
    for worshiping God that would replace the portable Tent of Meeting.
