Israel Sinned 20-01
=====================


The **kingdom of Israel** and the **kingdom of Judah** both **sinned**
against **God**. They **broke the covenant** that God had made with
them at **Sinai**. God sent his **prophets** to **warn them to repent**
and **worship** him again, but they refused to **obey**.

Translation Notes:
------------------

-   **broke the covenant** - That is, “disobeyed the commands God had
    given them in his covenant with them at Mount Sinai.”
-   **warn them to repent and worship him again** – Another way to
    translate this would be, “tell them to stop sinning and to worship
    Yahweh instead of other gods, or terrible things would happen
    to them.”
