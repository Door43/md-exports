Solomon Served Other Gods 18-03
=================================


But **Solomon** loved women from other countries. He **disobeyed** **God**
by marrying many women, almost 1,000 of them! Many of these women came
from foreign countries and **brought their gods with them** and continued
to **worship** them. When Solomon was old, he also worshiped their gods.

Translation Notes:
------------------

-   **brought their gods with them** - They brought their idols and
    their methods of worshiping idols with them to Israel.
