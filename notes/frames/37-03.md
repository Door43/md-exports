Lazarus Was Dead 37-03
========================


**Jesus'** **disciples** replied, “**Master**, if **Lazarus** is
sleeping, then **he will get better**.” Then Jesus told them plainly,
“**Lazarus is dead**. **I am glad** that I was not there, so that you
may **believe** in me.”

Translation Notes:
------------------

-   **he will get better** - The disciples intended this in the sense
    of, “there is no reason for us to go to him now, since he will
    get well.”
-   **I am glad** - This could be translated as, “I am happy” or,
“It is
    good that.” It does not mean he was happy that Lazarus died, but
    rather that he was happy that God was going to show how great he is.
