The Good News 50-02
=====================


As we wait for **Jesus** to return, **God** wants us to live in a way
that is **holy** and that honors him. He also wants us to tell others
about his **kingdom**.  When Jesus was living on earth he said, “My
**disciples** will **preach** the **good news** about the kingdom of
God to people everywhere in the world, and then **the end will come**.”

Translation Notes:
------------------

-   **the end will come** - This could be translated as, “the end of
    this world will come” or, “the end of this world will happen”
    or, “this present world will end.”
