God Hates Sin 49-08
=====================


**Jesus** also told us that **God** hates **sin**. When **Adam**
and **Eve** **sinned**, it affected all of their **descendants**.
As a result, every person in the world sins and **is separated from
God**. Therefore, everyone has become an enemy of God.

Translation Notes:
------------------

-   **is separated from God** - This can also be translated as, “cannot
    live with God” or, “cannot be near God” or, “cannot have a
    relationship with God.”
