The Two Robbers 40-04
=======================


**Jesus** was **crucified** between **two robbers**. One of them
**mocked** Jesus, but the other said, “Do you have no fear of
**God**? **We are guilty, but this man is innocent**.” Then he said to
Jesus, “**Please remember me** **in your kingdom**.” Jesus answered
him, “Today, you will be with me in **Paradise**.”

Translation Notes:
------------------

-   **two robbers** - This could also be translated as, “two bandits.”
    This refers to criminals who used force or violence to steal things.
-   **Do you have no fear of God?** - The robber does not expect an
    answer to this question; it is a way that some languages use to make
    a strong statement. If your language does not use questions in this
    way, then translate this as, “You should fear God!”
-   **We are guilty but this man is innocent** – This could be
    translated as, “You and I have done evil things and deserve to die,
    but this man, Jesus, has done nothing wrong and does not deserve to
    die.” “We” here includes both robbers, but does not include
    Jesus.
-   **this man** - This phrase refers to Jesus.  -   **Please remember
me** - That is, “Please accept me” or, “Please
    welcome me” or, “Please allow me to be with you.” “Remember”
    here does not mean to recall something after forgetting it. Translate
    this in a way that communicates a humble request.
-   **in your kingdom** – That is, “when you establish your
kingdom” or,
    “when you are ruling as king.”
-   **Paradise** - This is another name for “heaven.”
