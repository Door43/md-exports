==========================


**God** **opened Lydia's heart to understand** the message about
**Jesus**, and **she and her family were baptized**.  She invited **Paul**
and **Silas** to stay at her house, **so they stayed with her and her
family**.

understand** - That is, “to understand and believe.” -   **she and
her family were baptized** - This can also be translated
    as, “they baptized Lydia and her family.”
-   **so they stayed with her and her family** - This was the normal
    custom of the day for people to provide hospitality to visitors in
    their homes. There were no immoral motives in this arrangement.
