Gideon's Army 16-12
=====================


Then **Gideon** returned to his soldiers and gave each of them a
**horn**, a clay pot, and **a torch**. They surrounded the camp where
the **Midianite** soldiers were sleeping. Gideon's 300 men soldiers had
the torches in the pots so the Midianites could not see the light of
the torches.

Translation Notes:
------------------

-   **horn** - This could be translated as, “trumpet” or, “ram's
horn
    trumpet.” These horns came from a male sheep and were often used
    to call men for battle.
-   **a torch** - This was probably a piece of wood wrapped with cloth
    and soaked in oil so that it could burn well. (This was not the
    modern torch that runs on batteries.)
