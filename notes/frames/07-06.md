Isaac Sent Jacob Away 07-06
=============================


But **Rebekah** heard of **Esau’s plan**. So **she and Isaac sent
Jacob far away to live with her relatives**.

Translation Notes:
------------------

-   **Esau's plan** - Esau's plan was to kill Jacob after his father
    died.
-   **she and Isaac sent Jacob** – Rebekah wanted to protect Jacob from
    Esau so she talked to Isaac about sending Jacob away.
-   **far away to live with her relatives** - This was the same place
    where Rebekah was living when Abraham's servant got her to be Isaac's
    wife. To make this clear, you could add, “relatives in the same
    land where she used to live.” The land was to the east, several
    hundred miles away.
-   **her relatives** - This could also be translated as, “their
    relatives.” Since Abraham's brother was Rebekah's grandfather,
    her relatives were also Isaac's relatives.
