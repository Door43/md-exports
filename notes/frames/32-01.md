Translation Notes:
------------------

-   **One day** - This phrase introduces an event that happened in the
    past, but does not state the specific time. Many languages have a
    similar way to begin telling a true story.
-   **the Gerasene people** - The Gerasenes lived in an area along the
    eastern shore of the Sea of Galilee. They are descendants of the Jews,
    but we know few details about them.
