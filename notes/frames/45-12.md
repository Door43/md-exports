Philip Baptized the Ethiopian 45-12
=====================================


So they went down into the water, and Philip **baptized** the
Ethiopian. After they came up out of the water, the **Holy Spirit**
suddenly **carried Philip away** to another place where he continued
telling people about **Jesus**.

Translation Notes:
------------------

-   **carried Philip away** - That is, “took Philip away” or,
“snatched
    Philip away.”
