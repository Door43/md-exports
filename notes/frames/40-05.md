Come Down from the Cross 40-05
================================


The **Jewish leaders** and the other people in the crowd **mocked**
**Jesus**. They said to him, “If you are the **Son of God**, come down
from the **cross** and **save** yourself! Then we will **believe** you.”

Translation Notes:
------------------

-   **believe you** – That is, “believe in you” or, “believe
that you
    are the Messiah.”
