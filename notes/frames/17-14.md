Solomon Was Born 17-14
========================


But as **punishment** for **David's** **sin**, his baby boy died.  There
was also **fighting in David’s family** for the rest of his life, and
**David’s power was greatly weakened**. Though David had been unfaithful
to **God**, God was still **faithful** to his **promises**. Later,
David and **Bathsheba** had another son, and they named him **Solomon**.

*A Bible story from: 1 Samuel 10; 15-19; 24; 31; 2 Samuel 5; 7; 11-12*

Translation Notes:
------------------

-   **fighting in David’s family** - This “fighting” was very
serious.
    Among other things, one of his sons murdered another son and tried
    to take David's place as king while David was still reigning. If
    possible, use a word that conveys the intensity of this conflict
    within the family.
-   **David’s power was greatly weakened** - This might be translated
    as, “David became less powerful” or, “David lost much of his
    authority.”
-   *A Bible story from* - These references may be slightly different in
    some Bible translations.
