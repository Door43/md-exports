The Deliverer 16-03
=====================


Then **God provided** a **deliverer** who rescued them from their
enemies and **brought peace** to **the land**. But then **the people
forgot about God** and started **worshiping** **idols** again. So God
allowed the **Midianites**, a nearby enemy people group, to defeat them.

Translation Notes:
------------------

-   **God provided** - This could be translated as, “God chose”
or, “God
    appointed” or, “God raised up.”
-   **brought peace** - This could be translated as, “allowed the people
    to live without fear” or, “ended the fighting” or, “stopped
    their enemies from attacking them.”
-   **the land** - That refers to Canaan, the Promised Land that God had
    given to Abraham.
-   **the people forgot about God** - This means, “The people stopped
    thinking about God and ignored what he had commanded them.”
