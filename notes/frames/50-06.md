The Weeds 50-06
=================


“When the plants sprouted, the **servants** of the man said,
‘**Master**, you planted **good** seed in that field.  So why are
there weeds in it?’ The master answered, ‘**An enemy must have
planted them**.’”

Translation Notes:
------------------

- -   **An enemy must have planted them** - If possible, translate this in
    a way that indicates that the speaker did not see this happen.
