Translation Notes:
------------------

-   **One day** - This phrase introduces an event that happened in the
    past, but does not state the specific time. Many languages have a
    similar way to begin telling a true story.
-   **tax collectors** â€“ Tax collectors were considered to be the worst
    of sinners because often they stole money from people by collecting
    a higher tax than the government required.
