God's Spirit Was Poured Out 43-05
===================================


Some of the people **accused the disciples of being drunk**. But
**Peter** stood up and said to them, “Listen to me! These people
are not drunk! This **fulfills** the **prophecy** made by the prophet
**Joel** in which God said, ‘In **the last days**, I will **pour out
my Spirit**.’”

Translation Notes:
------------------

-   **accused the disciples of being drunk** - This could also be
    translated as, “said that the disciples were drunk.”
-   **Joel** - Joel was a prophet in Israel who lived hundreds of years
    before this happened.
-   **the last days** - This refers to, “the final days before the end
    of the world.”
-   **pour out my Spirit** - This can be understood in the sense of,
    “give my Spirit generously to people” or, “cause my Spirit to
    completely empower people.”
-   **my Spirit** - That is, “my Holy Spirit.”
