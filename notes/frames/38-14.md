Judas Betrayed Jesus 38-14
============================


**Judas** came with the **Jewish leaders**, soldiers, and a large
crowd. They were carrying swords and clubs. Judas **came to** **Jesus**
and said, “**Greetings**, **Teacher**,” and kissed him. This was
**the sign** for the Jewish leaders to know whom to arrest. Then Jesus
said, “Judas, **do you betray me with a kiss**?”

Translation Notes:
------------------

-   **came to** - Some languages may prefer to say, “went to.”
-   **Greetings** - This can also be translated as, “Hello” or,
“Peace”
    or, “Good evening.”
-   **the sign** - That is, “the signal.” -   **do you betray me
with a kiss?** - That is, “are you really going
    to betray me with a kiss?” Jesus is not looking for an answer to
    this question. So some languages would translate it as a statement,
    such as, “you are betraying me by kissing me!” or, “you make
    your betrayal even worse by kissing me!”
