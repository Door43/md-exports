Enemies Defeated Israel 16-02
===============================


Because the **Israelites** kept **disobeying** **God**, he **punished**
them by allowing their enemies to defeat them. These enemies stole
things from the Israelites, destroyed their property, and killed many
of them. After many years of disobeying God and being oppressed by their
enemies, the Israelites **repented** and **asked God to rescue them**.

Translation Notes:
------------------

-   **asked God to rescue them** - That is, they asked God to help them
    and to set them free from their enemies.
