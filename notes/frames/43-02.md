The Feast of Pentecost 43-02
==============================


Every year, 50 days after the **Passover**, the **Jews** celebrated
an important day called **Pentecost**. Pentecost was a time when the
Jews **celebrated the harvest**. Jews came from all over the world to
**Jerusalem** to celebrate Pentecost together. **This year**, the time for
Pentecost came about a week after **Jesus** had gone back to **heaven**.

Translation Notes:
------------------

-   **Pentecost** - “Pentecost” means “fiftieth .” You could use
    the word “Pentecost” in your translation and let the text explain
    the meaning. Or you could use a term that means, “50th day.”
-   **celebrated the harvest** - The Jews would thank God for the
    harvest by bringing offerings and celebrate by having special meals.
-   **This year** - That is, “In the year that Jesus died.”
