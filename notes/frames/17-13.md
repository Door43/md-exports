Nathan Rebuked David 17-13
============================


After **Uriah** was killed, **David** married **Bathsheba**.  Later, she
gave birth to David's son.  **God** was very angry about what David had
done, so he sent the **prophet** **Nathan** to tell David how **evil**
his **sin** was. David **repented** of his sin and God **forgave** him.
For the rest of his life, **David followed and obeyed God**, even in
difficult times.

Translation Notes:
------------------

-   **what David had done** - This refers to David's adultery with
    Bathsheba and his murder of her husband, Uriah.
