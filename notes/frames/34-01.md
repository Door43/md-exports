The Mustard Seed 34-01
========================


**Jesus** told many other **stories** about the **kingdom of God**. For
example, he said, “The kingdom of God is like a **mustard seed** that
someone planted in his field. You know that the mustard seed is **the
smallest seed of all**.”

Translation Notes:
------------------

-   **stories** - Jesus used these stories to teach truths about God's
    kingdom. It is not clear if the events actually happened or not. If
    your language has a term that includes both fictional and real
    stories, you should use it here.
-   **mustard seed** - This probably refers to the seed of the black
    mustard plant, which has tiny seeds that rapidly grow into very
    large plants. If there is a word for this plant in your language,
    you should use it. If not, you may need to substitute the name of
    another plant which has the same characteristics.
-   **the smallest seed of all** - That is, “the smallest of all the
    seeds that people plant.”
