Judah Served Babylon 20-06
============================


About 100 years after the **Assyrians** destroyed the **kingdom
of Israel**, **God** sent **Nebuchadnezzar**, **king** of the
**Babylonians**, to attack the **kingdom of Judah**.  **Babylon** was a
powerful **empire**. The king of Judah agreed **to be Nebuchadnezzar’s
servant** and pay him a lot of money every year.

Translation Notes:
------------------

-   **empire** - See how you translated this in -   **agreed to be**
– The king of Judah was forced to either serve the
    Babylonian king or be destroyed.
-   **to be Nebuchadnezzar's servant** - This could be translated as,
    “to govern Judah under Nebuchadnezzar's command.”
