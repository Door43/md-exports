**begging** for money.

Translation Notes:
------------------

-   **One day** - This phrase introduces an event that happened in the
    past, but does not state the specific time. Many languages have a
    similar way to begin telling a true story.
-   **a crippled man** - This could also be translated as, “a lame
man.”
    This refers to a man who did not have full use of his legs, and
    could not stand or walk.
