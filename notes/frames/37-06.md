Mary Met Jesus 37-06
======================


Then **Mary** arrived. She **fell at the feet of Jesus** and said,
“**Master**, if only you had been here, **my brother would not have
died**.” Jesus asked them, “Where have you put **Lazarus**?” They
told him, “In the **tomb**. Come and see.” Then Jesus wept.

Translation Notes:
------------------

-   **Mary** - This was the same woman as in
    not the mother of Jesus.
-   **fell at the feet of Jesus** - That is, “knelt down at Jesus'
feet”
    as a sign of respect.
-   **my brother would not have died.** - That is, “you could have kept
    my brother from dying” or, “you could have prevented my brother's
    death” or, “my brother would still be alive.”
