The Lie 02-04
===============


The snake responded to the woman, “That is not **true**! You will
not **die**.  **God** just knows that as soon as you eat it, you will
be **like God** and will **understand good and evil** like he does.”

Translation Notes:
------------------

-   **like God** - The man and the woman were already made in the
    likeness of God. The snake is suggesting that the woman would be
    more like God if she understood evil. However, God never intended
    for her to have this knowledge.
-   **understand good and evil** - To know from personal experience what
    things are good and what things are bad, or being able to know
    whether something is good or bad.
