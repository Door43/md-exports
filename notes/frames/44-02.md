Get Up and Walk 44-02
=======================


**Peter** looked at the lame man and said, “I do not have any money to
give you. But I will give you what I do have. **In the name of Jesus**,
**get up** and walk!”

Translation Notes:
------------------

-   **In the name of Jesus** - “Name” here stands for the authority
and
    power of the person. Therefore, this expression here means, “by
    the authority of Jesus.”
-   **get up** - That is, “stand up.”
