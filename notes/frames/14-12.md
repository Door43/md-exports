Translation Notes:
------------------

-   **miraculously gave them water from a rock** - This could be
    translated, “by doing something that only God can do, he made
    water pour out of a rock so the people and animals could drink.”
-   **But despite all this** - This could be translated as, “But even
    though God provided food, water, clothing, and everything that
    they needed.”
-   **Even so** - This could be translated, “Even though the Israelites
    complained and grumbled against him.”
-   **God was still faithful to his promises** - This could be
    translated, “God continued to do what he had told Abraham, Isaac,
    and Jacob he would do.” He provided their descendants with what
    they needed so they that could live and become a great nation and
    eventually own the land of Canaan.
