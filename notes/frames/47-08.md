Paul and Silas in Prison 47-08
================================


They put **Paul** and **Silas** in the most secure part of the prison
and even locked up their feet. Yet **in the middle of the night**,
they were **singing songs of praise to God**.

Translation Notes:
------------------

-   **in the middle of the night** – This could be translated as,
“very
    late at night” or, “very early in the morning.” This was when
    it was completely dark outside, when people would normally be asleep.
-   **singing songs of praise to God** - This can also be translating
    as, “praising God by singing” or, “singing songs to praise
    God” or, “singing songs that gave praise to God.”
