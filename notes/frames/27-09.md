Help for the Victim 27-09
===========================


“The **Samaritan** then lifted the man onto **his own donkey** and
took him to a **roadside inn** **where he took care of him**.”

Translation Notes:
------------------

- -   **his own donkey** – Make sure it is clear that “his” refers
to the
    Samaritan.
-   **roadside inn** – That is, “a lodging place.” This is a
place where
    travelers could get food and stay overnight.
-   **where he took care of him** – This could also be translated as,
    “where he continued to take care of him.”
