The Mother of the Messiah 22-05
=================================


**Mary** replied, “**How can this be**, since I am a **virgin**?”
The **angel** explained, “The **Holy Spirit** will **come to you, and
the power of God will overshadow you**. So the baby will be **holy**,
the **Son of God**.” Mary **believed** and accepted what the angel said.

Translation Notes:
------------------

-   **How can this be** - That is, “How can I become pregnant?”
Mary was
    not doubting the truth of the angel's words, but asking how it
    would happen.
-   **Holy Spirit will come to you, and the power of God will overshadow
    you** - These are two ways of saying the same thing: “By the
    power of God, the Holy Spirit will miraculously cause you to become
    pregnant.” Make sure the translation of this sentence does not sound
    like there was any physical contact involved. This was a miracle.
