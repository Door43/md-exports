David and Bathsheba 17-10
===========================


**One day**, when all of **David's** soldiers were away from home fighting
battles, he looked out from his palace and **saw** a beautiful woman
**bathing**. Her name was **Bathsheba**.

Translation Notes:
------------------

-   **One day** - This phrase introduces an event that happened in the
    past, but does not state the specific time. Many languages have a
    similar way to begin telling a true story.
-   **saw** - Bathsheba may have been bathing at her own house, but
    David's palace was very high and he was able to see over walls that
    were lower.
-   **bathing** - This may be translated as, “taking a bath” or,
    “washing herself.”
