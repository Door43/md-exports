You Killed the Messiah 45-03
==============================


The **high priest** asked Stephen, “**Are these things true**?”
Stephen replied by reminding them of many of the great things **God**
had done from the time of **Abraham** to the time of **Jesus**, and how
God's people continually **disobeyed** him. Then he said, “You stubborn
and **rebellious** people **always reject the Holy Spirit**, just as
**your ancestors** always rejected God and killed his **prophets**. But
you did something worse than they did! You killed the **Messiah**!”

Translation Notes:
------------------

-   **Are these things true?** - That is, “Are these accusations against
    you true?” or, “Are the things these people are saying about
    you true?” or, “Is it true that you said evil things about Moses
    and God?”
-   **always reject the Holy Spirit** - That is, “never obey the Holy
    Spirit” or, “always refuse to listen to the Holy Spirit.”
-   **your ancestors** - This could be translated as, “your ancestors,
    the Israelites.”
