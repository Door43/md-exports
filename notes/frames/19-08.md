Baal Did Not Answer 19-08
===========================


Then the **prophets** of **Baal** **prayed to Baal**, “Hear us, Baal!”
All day long they prayed and **shouted** and even **cut themselves with
knives**, but **there was no answer**.

Translation Notes:
------------------

-   **prayed to Baal** - the prophets of Baal asked Baal to send fire
    onto the bull they prepared as a sacrifice.
-   **shouted** - They yelled or called out loudly to Baal.  -   **cut
themselves with knives** - They injured themselves with knives
    as an extreme way to show their devotion to Baal, hoping that this
    would persuade him to listen to them.
-   **there was no answer** - There was no response of any kind to their
    shouting, and no fire came to burn up the sacrifice.
