God Defeated the Midianites 16-14
===================================


**God confused the Midianites**, so that they started attacking and
killing each other. Immediately, **the rest of the Israelites were
called** from their homes to come help chase the Midianites. They
killed many of them and chased the rest of them out of the Israelites'
land. 120,000 Midianites died that day. God had **saved** **Israel**.

Translation Notes:

-   **God confused the Midianites** - God caused the Midianites to be
    confused. They wanted to attack the Israelites, but instead, they
    attacked each other.

    other Israelite men.” This refers to the soldiers previously sent
    home in
-   **were called** – That is, “were called out” or, “were
summoned.”
    This sentence could also be translated as, “Gideon sent messengers
    to summon many other Israelite men from their homes.”
