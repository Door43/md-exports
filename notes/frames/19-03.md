God Provided for Elijah 19-03
===============================


**God** told **Elijah** to go to a stream in **the wilderness** to hide
from Ahab who wanted to kill him.  Every morning and every evening,
birds would bring him bread and meat.  **Ahab** and his army looked for
Elijah, but they could not find him. **The drought** was so severe that
the stream eventually dried up.

Translation Notes:
------------------

-   **the wilderness** - This was a remote location with very few
    people. This may also be translated as, “desert” or, “the
    bush.”
-   **The drought** - This could be translated as, “the lack of rain.”
    This drought was a result of Elijah declaring that there would be
    no rain.
