Peter Denied Jesus 39-07
==========================


Then **Peter vowed**, saying, “**May God curse me if I know this
man**!” Immediately, **a rooster crowed**, and **Jesus** turned around
and looked at Peter.

Translation Notes:
------------------

-   **vowed** - That is, “said emphatically” or, “said very
strongly.” -   **May God curse me if I know this man** - This is a
curse that
    means, “May God cause harm to me if what you say is true” or,
    “May God punish me if I am lying to you!” In this way Peter was
    saying very strongly that he did not know Jesus. He also referred
    to Jesus as, “this man” to make it sound like he did not know him.
-   **a rooster crowed** - “Crowing” is the loud sound that a rooster
    makes. Compare how you translated this in
