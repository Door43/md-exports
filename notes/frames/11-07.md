Sorrow in Egypt 11-07
=======================


Every **Egyptian** firstborn male died, **from the firstborn of the
prisoner in jail, to the firstborn of Pharaoh**.  Many people in **Egypt**
were crying and wailing because of their deep sadness.

Translation Notes:
------------------

-   **from the firstborn of the prisoner in jail, to the firstborn of
    Pharaoh** - This is a way of saying that everyone's firstborn son
    diedâ€“from the son of the least important person to the son of the
    most important person, and everyone in between.
