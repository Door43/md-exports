The Ministry of Elijah 26-05
==============================


Then **Jesus** said, “It is **true** that **no prophet is accepted
in his own hometown**. During the time of the prophet **Elijah**, there
were many widows in **Israel**.  But when it did not rain for three and
a half years, **God** did not send Elijah to help a widow from Israel,
but rather to a widow from a different nation.”

Translation Notes:
------------------

-   **no prophet is accepted in his hometown** - This phrase means,
    “people do not recognize the authority of a prophet that has grown
    up among them.”
