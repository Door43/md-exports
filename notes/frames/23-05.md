The Birth of Jesus 23-05
==========================


When they arrived in **Bethlehem**, there was **no place to stay**. The
only room they could find was a **place where animals stayed**. The
baby was born there and his mother laid him in a **feeding trough**,
since they did not have a bed for him. They named him **Jesus**.

Translation Notes:
------------------

-   **no place to stay** - That is, “no usual place to stay.” Because
    Bethlehem was so crowded at that time, the usual rooms for guests
    were already full of people.
-   **place where animals stayed** - This was a place for sheltering
    animals, not a place where people lived. Translate this with a term
    that would normally be used for a place where animals were kept.
-   **feeding trough** - That is, “animal feed box” or, “wooden
or stone
    box for feeding animals.” The box could have been filled with hay
    to provide a padded surface for the baby to lie on.
