The Evil Kings of Israel 18-11
================================


In the new **kingdom** of **Israel**, all the **kings** were
**evil**. Many of these kings were killed by other **Israelites** who
wanted to become king in their place.

Translation Notes:
------------------

-   **Israelites** - Here, “Israelites” refers only to the people
living
    in the northern kingdom of Israel, not to the people living in the
    southern kingdom of Judah.
