Make Disciples 42-10
======================


**Jesus** said to his **disciples**, “**All authority in heaven and
on earth has been given to me**. So go, **make disciples of all people
groups** by **baptizing** them **in the name of** the **Father**,
the **Son**, and the **Holy Spirit**, and by teaching them to **obey**
everything I have commanded you. Remember, I will be with you always.”

Translation Notes:
------------------

-   **All authority in heaven and on earth has been given to me** - This
    can also be translated as, “God has given me all authority in
    heaven and on earth” or, “God has given me complete authority
    over everyone in heaven and on earth” or, “I have all authority
    in heaven an on earth.”
-   **make disciples of all people groups** - That is, “help people from
    every people group become my disciples.”
-   **in the name of** - This phrase means both, “by the authority of”
    and, “under the authority of.” Consider translating the word
    “name” literally if it will be understood in this way in your
    language.  This phrase can also be repeated as in, “in the name
    of the Father, in the name of the Son, and in the name of the Holy
    Spirit.”
