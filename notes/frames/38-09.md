Jesus Prayed for Peter 38-09
==============================


**Peter** replied, “Even if all the others **abandon you**, I will
not!” Then **Jesus** said to Peter, “**Satan** wants **to have all
of you**, but I have **prayed** for you, Peter, **that your faith will
not fail**. Even so, tonight, **before the rooster crows**, you will
deny that you even know me three times.”

Translation Notes:
------------------

-   **abandon you** – Check to see how you translated this in -   **to
have all of you** - That is, “to completely control you” or,
    “to get you to serve him completely.” The word “you” is
    plural in this phrase. All of the words “you” and “your”
    that follow are singular.
-   **that your faith will not fail** - That is, “that you will not stop
    believing in me.”
-   **before the rooster crows** - Roosters normally crow at the first
    light of the new day. If that is not clear, it may be helpful to say,
    “Before the rooster crows at dawn tomorrow” or, “before the
    rooster crows tomorrow morning.”
