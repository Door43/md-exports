Moses Divided the Sea 12-07
=============================


**God** told **Moses** to **raise his hand over the sea** and divide
the waters. Then God caused wind to push the water in the sea to the
left and the right, so that a path formed through the sea.

Translation Notes:
------------------

-   **raise his hand over the sea** - This could be translated as, “held
    out his hand over the sea”. This was a gesture to show that God
    was doing this miracle through Moses.
