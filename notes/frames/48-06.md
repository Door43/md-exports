The Great High Priest 48-06
=============================


For hundreds of years, **priests** continually offered **sacrifices**
to **God** for people to show the punishment that they deserved for
their **sins**. But those sacrifices could not take away their sin.
**Jesus** is the **Great High Priest**.  Unlike other priests, **he
offered himself** as the only sacrifice that could to take away the sin
of all the people in the world. Jesus was the perfect high priest because
he **took the punishment** for every sin that anyone has ever committed.

Translation Notes:
------------------

-   **he offered himself** - This could also be translated as, “Jesus
    allowed himself to be killed.”
-   **took the punishment** - That is, “received the punishment in his
    own body.”
