Peter Preached 44-05
======================


“You are the ones who told the **Roman** governor to kill **Jesus**. You
killed the **author of life**, but **God** **raised** him from the
**dead**. Although you did not understand what you were doing, God used
**your actions** to **fulfill** the **prophecies** that the **Messiah**
would **suffer** and die. So now, **repent** and **turn to God** so that
**your sins will be washed away**.”

Translation Notes:
------------------

- -   **author of life** - That is, “the one who created life” or,
“the
    one who gives us life” or, “the one who causes people to live.”
    This refers to Jesus.
-   **your actions** - This can also be translated as, “the things you
    did.” This refers to their asking Pilate to kill Jesus.
-   **turn to God** - That is, “decide to obey God.” -   **your sin
will be washed away** - This could be translated as, “God
    will wash away your sins” or, “God will take away your sins and
    make you clean.” This is talking about God purifying people in
    their spirit by completely removing their sins. It does not mean
    physical washing.
