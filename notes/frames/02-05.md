Disobedience 02-05
====================


The woman saw that the fruit was beautiful and looked delicious. She also
wanted to be **wise**, so she picked some of the fruit and ate it. Then
she gave some to her husband, **who was with her**, and he ate it, too.

Translation Notes:
------------------

-   **wise** - The woman wanted to have insight and understanding like
    the snake seemed to have, and like God has.
-   **who was with her** - This is important information because it
    shows that the man was present when the woman made the decision to
    eat the fruit.
