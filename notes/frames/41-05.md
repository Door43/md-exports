Jesus Is Risen 41-05
======================


When the women arrived at the tomb, the **angel** told them, “**Do
not be afraid**. **Jesus** is not here. **He has risen from the dead**,
just like he said he would! Look in the **tomb** and see.” The women
looked into the tomb and saw where Jesus' body had been laid. His body
was not there!

Translation Notes:
------------------

-   **Do not be afraid** - That is, “Stop being afraid.” An angel
    shining like lightning was a frightening sight!
-   **He has risen from the dead** – This could be translated as, “He
    has come back to life.”
