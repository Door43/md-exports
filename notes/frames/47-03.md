The Slave Girl 47-03
======================


**Paul** and **Silas** often met with people at the place of
**prayer**. Every day as they walked there, a **slave girl** **possessed
by a demon** followed them. By means of this **demon** she predicted
the future for people, so she made a lot of money for **her masters**
**as a fortuneteller**.

Translation Notes:
------------------

-   **her masters** - In this case, this could also be translated as,
    “her owners.”
-   **as a fortuneteller** - That is, “as someone who told people what
    would happen to them in the future.”
