Ananias Baptized Saul 46-05
=============================


So Ananias went to **Saul**, placed his hands on him, and said,
“**Jesus**, who appeared to you on your way **here**, sent me to you
so that you can **regain your sight** and be filled with the **Holy
Spirit**.” Saul immediately was able to see again, and Ananias
**baptized** him. Then Saul ate some food and **his strength returned**.

Translation Notes:
------------------

-   **here** - That is, “to Damascus.” -   **regain your sight** -
This could also be translated as, “be able
    to see again.”
-   **his strength returned** - This could also be translated as, “he
    became strong again” or, “he felt better.”
