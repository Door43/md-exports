The Walls Fell Down 15-05
===========================


Then the walls around **Jericho** fell down!  The **Israelites** destroyed
everything in the city as **God** had commanded. They only spared
**Rahab** and her family, who **became part of** the Israelites. When the
other people living in **Canaan** heard that the Israelites had destroyed
Jericho, they were terrified that the Israelites would attack them also.

Translation Notes:
------------------

-   **became part of** - This can be translated as, “who then joined the
    Israelite community” or, “who then became members of the nation
    of Israel.”
