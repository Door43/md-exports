The Two Sons 35-03
====================


“There was a man who had two **sons**. The younger son told his father,
‘Father, I want **my inheritance** now!’ So the father divided his
**property** between his two sons.”

Translation Notes:
------------------

- -   **my inheritance** – This could be translated as, “the part
of your
    wealth that will be rightfully mine when you die.”
-   **property** – That is, “wealth” or, “possessions.” This
property
    would probably have included land, animals, and money.
