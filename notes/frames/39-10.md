What Is Truth? 39-10
======================


**Jesus** answered, “**You have said so**, but **my kingdom is not an
earthly kingdom**. If it were, **my servants would fight for me**. I have
come to earth to tell the **truth** about **God**. Everyone who **loves**
the truth **listens to me**.” **Pilate** said, “**What is truth?**”

Translation Notes:
------------------

-   **You have said so** - That is, “You have spoken correctly.” -
**my kingdom is not an earthly kingdom** - That is, “my kingdom is
    not like earthly kingdoms.”
-   **my servants would fight for me** - That is, “my disciples would
    fight to protect me” so that I could establish my kingdom.
-   **listens to me** – This could be translated as, “hears my
teaching
    and obeys me.” It includes not just hearing Jesus' words, but also
    doing what he says.
-   **What is truth?** - that is, “Can anyone know what is true?”
