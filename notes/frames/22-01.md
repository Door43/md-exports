God Spoke to Zechariah 22-01
==============================


In the past, **God** had spoken to **his people** through his **angels**
and **prophets**. But then **400 years went by when he did not speak
to them**. Suddenly an angel came with a message from God to an old
**priest** named **Zechariah**.  Zechariah and his wife, Elizabeth,
were **godly people**, but she had not been able to have any children.

Translation Notes:
------------------

-   **his people** - This could be translated as, “his people, the
    Israelites” or “his people, the Jews.” But only include the
    added information if it is not clearly understood who these people
    were.
-   **400 years went by** - Another way to say this would be, “400 years
    passed” or “there were 400 years.” 400 years had passed since
    the last Old Testament prophet, Malachi.
-   **when he did not speak to them** – That is, “during which God did
    not give any messages to the prophets for his people.”
-   **godly people** - That is, “people who obeyed God.”
