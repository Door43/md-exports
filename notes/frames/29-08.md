The Wicked Servant 29-08
==========================


“The **king** **called the servant** and said, ‘You wicked servant! I
**forgave** your debt because you **begged me**. **You should have done
the same**.’ The king was so angry that he **threw** the **wicked**
servant into prison until he could pay back all of his debt.”

Translation Notes:
------------------

- -   **called the servant** - That is, “commanded the servant to
come to
    him” or, “ordered his guards to bring the servant to him.”
-   **begged me** – This could be translated as, “pleaded with
me” or,
    “urgently asked me to be merciful.”
-   **You should have done the same** - That is, “You should have
    forgiven the man who owed you, just as I forgave you.”
-   **threw** - That is, “commanded his guards to put.” Consider how
    “threw” was translated in frame
