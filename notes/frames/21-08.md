Messiah Will Rule Forever 21-08
=================================


A **king** is someone who rules over a **kingdom** and **judges**
the people.  The **Messiah** would be the perfect king who would **sit
on the throne** of his ancestor **David**. He would reign over **the
whole world** forever, and would always judge honestly and make the
right decisions.

Translation Notes:
------------------

-   **sit on the throne of his ancestor David** - A throne is a
    ceremonial chair for a king or queen that represents their
    authority. This expression could also be translated as, “have the
    authority to reign as his ancestor King David did” or, “be the
    descendant of King David and continue his rule over God's people.”
-   **the whole world** - This could also be translated as, “everyone
    everywhere.”
