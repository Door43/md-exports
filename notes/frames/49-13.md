God Loves You 49-13
=====================


**God** will **save** everyone who **believes** in **Jesus** and
**receives** him as their **Master**. But he will not save anyone who
does not believe in him. It does not matter if you are rich or poor, man
or woman, old or young, or where you live. God **loves** you and wants
you to believe in Jesus so **he can have a close relationship with you**.

Translation Notes:
------------------

-   **he can have a close relationship with you** - This can also be
    translated as, “so that you can be his child” or, “so that
    you can be his friend” or, “so you can belong to him.”
