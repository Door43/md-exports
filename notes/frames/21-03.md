A Prophet Like Moses 21-03
============================


**God** **promised** **Moses** that in the future he would **raise
up another prophet like Moses**.  This was another promise about the
**Messiah** who would come at some later time.

Translation Notes:
------------------

-   **raise up another prophet like Moses** - That is, “appoint another
    prophet like Moses” or, “cause another prophet to come who would
    be like Moses.”
-   **prophet like Moses** - To be like Moses, the future prophet would
    need to have great authority from God to lead and rescue his people.
