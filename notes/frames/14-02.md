The Canaanites' Idols 14-02
=============================


**God** had **promised** **Abraham**, **Isaac**, and **Jacob** that
he would give the **Promised Land** to their **descendants**, but
now there were many **people groups** living there. They were called
**Canaanites**. The Canaanites did not **worship** or **obey** God. They
worshiped **false gods** and did many **evil** things.
