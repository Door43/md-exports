The First Temptation 25-02
============================


**Satan** **tempted** **Jesus** by saying, “If you are the **Son of
God**, **turn these rocks into bread** so you can eat!”

Translation Notes:
------------------

-   **turn these rocks into bread** - This may also be translated as,
    “make these rocks become bread” or, “supernaturally change
    these rocks into bread.”
-   **bread** – This could be translated as, “food” for languages
where
    bread is not a common food. In the Jews' culture, bread was the
    main food.
