Unable to Speak 22-03
=======================


The **angel** responded to Zechariah, “I was sent by **God** to bring
you this good news. Because you did not **believe** me, you will not
be able to speak until the child is born.” Immediately, **Zechariah**
was unable to speak. Then the angel left Zechariah. After this, Zechariah
returned home and his wife **became pregnant**.

Translation Notes:
------------------

-   **became pregnant** - Some languages have polite ways of saying
    “become pregnant.” Use an expression that will not be embarrassing
    to readers.
