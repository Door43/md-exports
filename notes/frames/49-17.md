Follow Jesus' Teachings 49-17
===============================


If you are a friend of **God** and a **servant** of **Jesus** the
**Master**, you will want to **obey** what Jesus teaches you. Even though
you are a **Christian**, you will still **be tempted to sin**. But God
**is faithful** and says that if you **confess your sins**, he will
**forgive** you. **He will give you strength to fight against sin**.

Translation Notes:
------------------

-   **be tempted to sin** - That is, ““be tempted to sin even
though you
    know sin is wrong.”
-   **is faithful** - In this context this means that God, “keeps his
    promises.”
-   **confess your sins** - This could be translated as, “admit to God
    what you have done wrong.”
-   **He will give you strength to fight against sin** - That is, “He
    will give you spiritual strength to refuse to sin.”
