An Egyptian Beat a Slave 09-08
================================


One day, when **Moses** had **grown up**, he saw an **Egyptian**
beating an **Israelite** **slave**. Moses tried to **save** his **fellow
Israelite**.

Translation Notes:
------------------

-   **grown up** - Another way to say this would be, “grown into a
man.” -   **fellow Israelite** - This phrase refers to the Israelite
slave.
    The word “fellow” here indicates that Moses was also an Israelite.
    Although the daughter of the Egyptian Pharaoh raised Moses, Moses
    remembered that he was really an Israelite.
