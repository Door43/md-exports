Joseph Was Sold as a Slave 08-02
==================================


**Joseph’s** brothers hated him because their father loved him most
and because Joseph had **dreamed** that he would be their ruler. When
Joseph **came to his brothers**, they **kidnapped** him and sold him to
some **slave traders**.

Translation Notes:
------------------

-   **came to his brothers** – Another way this could be translated is,
    “reached the place where his brothers were.”
-   **kidnapped** - They took him against his will. It was not right for
    them to do this.
-   **slave traders** - These were people who made a business of buying
    people from one owner and selling them as slaves to another owner.
