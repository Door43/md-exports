The Name of God 09-14
=======================


**Moses** asked, “What if **the people** want to know who sent me,
what should I say?” **God** said, “**I AM WHO I AM**. Tell them,
‘**I AM** has sent me to you.’ Also tell them, 'I am **Yahweh**,
the God of your ancestors **Abraham**, **Isaac**, and **Jacob**.' This
is **my name** forever.”

Translation Notes:
------------------

-   **the people** - See “my people” in -   **I AM WHO I AM** -
This description shows that God can only be
    defined by himself, not by anything else that we know of, and he
    cannot be compared to anyone else.
-   **I AM** - This name emphasizes that God is the only one who has
    always lived and always will live.
-   **my name** - The name that God told Moses and all of Israel to use
    for him is “Yahweh,” which is related to “I AM” and appears
    to mean, “HE IS.”
