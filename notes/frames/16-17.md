Sin and Deliverance 16-17
===========================


**This pattern repeated many times**: the **Israelites** would **sin**,
**God** would **punish** them, they would **repent**, and God would
send a **deliverer** to **save** them. Over many years, God sent many
deliverers who saved the Israelites from their enemies.

Translation Notes:
------------------

-   **This pattern repeated many times** - This could be translated as,
    “These things kept happening again and again” or, “These things
    happened many times.”
