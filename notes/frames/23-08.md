The Shepherds Visited Jesus 23-08
===================================


The **shepherds** soon arrived at the place where **Jesus** was and they
found him lying in a feeding trough, just as the **angel** had told them.
They were very excited.  **Mary** was very happy, too.  The shepherds
returned to the fields where their sheep were, **praising** **God**
for **all they had heard and seen**.

Translation Notes:
------------------

-   **all they had heard and seen** - That is, “for everything they had
    heard and seen.” This included the glorious angels and their
    amazing message, as well as seeing the newborn Messiah himself.
