The Pigs Drowned 32-08
========================


The **demons** came out of the man and entered the pigs. The pigs ran
down a steep bank into the lake and drowned. There were about 2,000 pigs
in the **herd**.

Translation Notes:
------------------

-   **herd** - That is, “herd of pigs” or, “group of pigs.” Many
    languages have specific names for groups of animals, such as “flock
    of sheep,” “herd of cattle,” “pack of dogs,” and “school
    of fish.” Use a word that can appropriately be used for a large
    group of pigs.
