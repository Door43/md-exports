A Sacrifice Without Fire 19-07
================================


Then **Elijah** said to the **prophets** of **Baal**, “Kill a bull and
prepare it as a **sacrifice**, but do not light the fire. I will do the
same. The **God who answers with fire** is **the real God**.” So the
**priests** of Baal prepared a sacrifice but did not light the fire.

Translation Notes:
------------------

-   **who answers with fire** - That is, “who supernaturally sends fire
    to burn up the sacrifice.”
-   **the real God** - This means the one and only true God.
