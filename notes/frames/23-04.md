The Trip to Bethlehem 23-04
=============================


**When the time was near for Mary to give birth**, the **Roman
government** told everyone to go **for a census** to the town where their
ancestors had lived. **Joseph** and Mary had to make a long journey from
where they lived in **Nazareth** to **Bethlehem** because their ancestor
was **David** whose hometown was Bethlehem.

Translation Notes:
------------------

-   **When the time was near for Mary to give birth** - That is, “When
    it was near the end of Mary's pregnancy.”
-   **Roman government** - Rome had conquered and ruled over Israel at
    this time.
-   **for a census** - That is, “to be counted for the government
    record” or, “so that the government could write their names on
    a list” or, “to be counted by the government.” This census
    was probably made for the purpose of taxing the people.
