The Hail 10-08
================


**After that**, **God sent hail** that destroyed most of the crops
in **Egypt** and killed anybody who went outside.  **Pharaoh** called
**Moses** and **Aaron** and told them, “I have **sinned**. **You may
go**.” So Moses **prayed**, and the hail stopped falling from the sky.

Translation Notes:
------------------

-   **After that** - This means, after God caused the painful sores to
    appear on the Egyptians' skin.
-   **God sent hail** - God caused hail to fall from the sky.  -
**hail** - Hail is like chunks of ice that fall down from the clouds
    as rain does. These chunks can be very small or very large. The
    larger ones will hurt or kill whatever they fall on.
-   **You may go** - The word “you” refers to Moses, Aaron, and the
    Israelites.
