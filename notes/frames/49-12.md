Jesus Died and Rose Again 49-12
=================================


**Good works cannot save you**. There is nothing you can do to have a
relationship with **God**. Only **Jesus** can **wash away your sins**. You
must **believe** that Jesus is the **Son of God**, that he **died** on the
**cross** **instead of you**, and that God **raised him to life again**.

Translation Notes:
------------------

-   **Good works cannot save you** - That is, “Doing good things cannot
    save you from your sins” or, “You cannot do anything good enough
    to save yourself from the penalty for your sins.”
-   **wash away your sins** - That is, “completely remove your
sins” or,
    “take away your sins and make you clean.” This is talking
    about God purifying people in their spirit by completely removing
    their sins.  It does not mean physical washing.
-   **instead of you** – That is, “ in your place.” -   **raised
him to life again** - This could also be translated as,
    “made him alive again.”
