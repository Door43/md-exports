God Raised Jesus 43-07
========================


“Although **Jesus** died, **God** **raised** him from the
**dead**. **This fulfills the prophecy which says**, ‘**You will not
let your** **Holy One** **rot in the grave**.’ We are **witnesses**
to the fact that God **raised Jesus to life again**.”

Translation Notes:
------------------

- -   **This fulfills the prophecy which says** – Another way to
translate
    this would be, “This caused to come true what one of the prophets
    said long ago.”
-   **You will not let your** - “You” and “your” refer to God the
    Father. To make that clear, this could be translated as, “You,
    God, will not let your.” Some languages may have a special way of
    addressing someone, such as, “You, O God.”
-   **rot in the grave** - That is, “decay in the tomb” or,
“decompose
    in the grave.” This refers to the fact that Jesus did not remain
    in the tomb very long and is another way of saying that he did not
    stay dead, but rather came back to life again.
-   **raised Jesus to life again** - That is, “made Jesus alive
again.”
