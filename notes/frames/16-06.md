Gideon Destroyed the Idol 16-06
=================================


**Gideon's** father had an **altar** dedicated to an **idol**.  **God**
told Gideon **to tear down** that altar. But Gideon was **afraid of the
people**, so he **waited until nighttime**. Then he tore down the altar
and smashed it to pieces. He built a new altar to God near where the
altar to the idol used to be and made a **sacrifice** to God on it.

Translation Notes:
------------------

-   **to tear down** - This means, “to violently bring down” or, “to
    take down and destroy.”
-   **afraid of the people** - Gideon was afraid that his fellow
    Israelites who worshiped the same idol would be angry with him.
-   **waited until nighttime** - Another way to say this would be,
    “waited until after dark.” Gideon smashed the altar at night
    when everyone was asleep so that no one would see him do it.
