Jesus Was Nailed to the Cross 40-02
=====================================


The soldiers brought **Jesus** to a place called “**the Skull**” and
nailed his arms and feet to the **cross**. But Jesus said, “**Father**,
**forgive them, because they do not know what they are doing**.”
**Pilate** commanded that they write, “**King of the Jews**” on a
sign and put it on the cross above Jesus’ head.

Translation Notes:
------------------

-   **the Skull** - A hill near Jerusalem with a white, rocky top that
    was shaped somewhat like the top of a skull.
-   **forgive them, because they do not know what they are doing** -
    That is, “they do not understand the meaning of what they are
    doing, so please forgive them.” The soldiers thought Jesus was
    only a criminal who deserved to die. They did not understand that
    he was the Son of God.
