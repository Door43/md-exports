The Messiah Will Bring Peace 21-13
====================================


The **prophets** also said that the **Messiah** would be perfect,
**having no sin**. He would **die** to **receive the punishment for other
people’s sin**. His punishment would bring **peace** between **God**
and people. For this reason, **it was God's will to crush the Messiah**.

Translation Notes:
------------------

-   **having no sin** - This can also be translated as “he never
    sinned.”
-   **receive the punishment for other people’s sin** - That is, “to
    take on himself the punishment that other people deserved” or,
    “to be punished in the place of other people.”
-   **it was God's will** - That is, “it fulfilled God's purpose.”
This
    phrase means that the Messiah's death was exactly what God had
    planned to happen in order that his sacrifice would pay for the sins
    of the people.
-   **to crush** - That is, “to damage completely,” “to kill”
or, “to
    completely destroy.”
