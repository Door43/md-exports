A Storm Ended the Drought 19-13
=================================


Then **Elijah** said to **King** **Ahab**, “Return immediately to the
city, because the rain is coming.” Soon **the sky grew black**, and a
heavy rain began.  **Yahweh** had ended the **drought** and proved that
he is the true **God**.

Translation Notes:
------------------

-   **the sky grew black** - That is, “the sky became very dark.”
Heavy
    rainclouds covered the sky, making it look dark grey or black.
-   **drought** – That is, “long dry time with no rain.”
