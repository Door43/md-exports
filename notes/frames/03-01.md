=====================


**After a long time**, many people were living in the world. They had
become **very wicked and violent**. **It became so bad** that **God
decided to destroy** the whole world with a **huge flood**.

Translation Notes:
------------------

-   **After a long time** - This story happens many generations
     after creation.
-   **very wicked and violent** - It may be more natural to say, “had
    become wicked and did violent things”.
-   **It became so bad** – It may be clearer to say, “People were
    behaving in such harmful and evil ways that God.”
-   **God decided to destroy** - This does not mean that the earth would
    be destroyed completely. Rather God planned to destroy all the
    people who had rebelled against him and who had caused such evil
    and violence. This flood would also kill all the land animals and
    the birds.
-   **huge flood** - Very deep water that would cover the earth, even in
    places where the ground was normally dry, and even covering the tops
    of the highest mountains.
