The Birth of John 22-07
=========================


After **Elizabeth** gave birth to her baby boy, **Zechariah** and
Elizabeth named the baby **John**, as the **angel** had commanded.
Then **God** allowed **Zechariah** to speak again. Zechariah said,
“**Praise God**, because he has remembered his people! You, my son,
**will be called** **the prophet** of the **Most High God** who will
prepare the people to receive the **Messiah**!”

*A Bible story from: Luke 1*

Translation Notes:
------------------

-   **Elizabeth** - See the note about Elizabeth on -   **Praise God**
- That is, “We should all praise God.” -   **will be called** -
This is another way of saying, “will be” or,
    “will be known as.” John would actually be the Prophet of the
    Most High God.
-   **the prophet** - That is, “the very important prophet.” John
would
    be the prophet that the Old Testament prophets had predicted would
    come before the Messiah.
-   **Most High God** - Another way to say this would be, “the God who
    is greater than everything” or, “the God who rules over
    everything.”
-   *A Bible story from* - These references may be slightly different in
    some Bible translations.
