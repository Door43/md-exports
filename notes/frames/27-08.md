The Samaritan 27-08
=====================


“The next person to **walk down** that road was a **Samaritan**.
(Samaritans were the descendants of **Jews** who had married people
from other nations. Samaritans and Jews hated each other.) But when the
Samaritan saw the Jewish man, he felt very strong compassion for him. So
he cared for him and bandaged his wounds.”

Translation Notes:
------------------

- -   **walk down** – That is, “travel along.” These people were
traveling
    from one city to another. Make sure that it does not sound like they
    were just taking a walk.
