Naaman Was Healed 19-15
=========================


At first **Naaman** was angry and **would not do it because it seemed
foolish**. But later **he changed his mind** and dipped himself seven
times in the **Jordan River**. When he came up the last time, his skin
was completely **healed**!  **God** had healed him.

Translation Notes:
------------------

-   **would not do it because it seemed foolish** - Naaman would not do
    what Elisha said because he knew that washing alone could not heal
    his disease.
-   **he changed his mind** - That is, “he decided to do what Elisha had
    told him to do.”
