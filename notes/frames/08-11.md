The Brothers Bought Food 08-11
================================


So **Jacob** sent **his older sons** to **Egypt** to buy food. The
brothers **did not recognize Joseph** when they stood before him to buy
food. But Joseph recognized them.

Translation Notes:
------------------

-   **his older sons** - These were Joseph's older brothers who had sold
    him into slavery.
-   **did not recognize Joseph** - They did not know that the man was
    Joseph, because now Joseph was much older than when they last saw him,
    and he was dressed as an Egyptian ruler.
