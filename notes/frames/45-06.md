The People Attacked the Believers 45-06
=========================================


A young man named **Saul** agreed with the people who killed Stephen
and **guarded their robes** while they threw stones at him. That day,
many people in **Jerusalem** started **persecuting** the followers of
**Jesus**, so the **believers** fled to other places. **But in spite of
this**, they **preached** about Jesus everywhere they went.

Translation Notes:
------------------

-   **guarded their robes** - This could be translated as, “watched over
    their coats.” He was probably making sure they didn't get stolen
    or damaged.
-   **But in spite of this** – The Jewish leaders thought they could
    stop the spread of Jesus' teaching by persecuting his followers.
    Instead, this caused them to scatter and spread the message even
    more widely.
