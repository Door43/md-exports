Here Is Water 45-11
=====================


As Philip and the Ethiopian traveled, they came to **some water**. The
Ethiopian said, “Look! There is some water! **May I be baptized**?”
And he told the driver to stop the **chariot**.

Translation Notes:
------------------

-   **some water** - Use a term that means a larger body of water such
    as a pond, lake, or stream.
-   **May I be baptized?** - This could also be translated as, “Is there
    any reason that I cannot be baptized?”
