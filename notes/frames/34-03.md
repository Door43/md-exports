The Yeast 34-03
=================


**Jesus** told another **story**, “The **kingdom of God** is like
**yeast** that a woman mixes into some **bread dough** until **it spreads
throughout the dough**.”

Translation Notes:
------------------

-   **story** - See how you translated this term in -   **yeast** -
This can also be translated as, “leaven” or, “the little
    bit of leaven.” It is added to bread dough to make it rise. A
    little bit of yeast can be mixed into a large amount of dough and
    make the whole batch of dough rise.
-   **bread dough** - This is a mixture of flour and liquid that can be
    shaped and baked into bread. If you do not have words for dough
    or flour, you can borrow a word for flour or call it “ground-up
    grain.”
-   **it spreads throughout the dough** - That is, “every part of the
    dough has yeast in it” or, “the yeast grows throughout all
    the dough.”
