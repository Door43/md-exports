God's Commandments 28-02
==========================


“**Which ones do I need to obey?**” he asked.  **Jesus** replied,
“Do not murder. Do not commit **adultery**. Do not steal. Do not
lie. Honor your father and mother, and **love** your neighbor **as you
love yourself**.”

Translation Notes:
------------------

-   **Which ones do I need to obey?** - That is, “Which laws will be
    enough for me to receive eternal life?”
-   **as you love yourself** - That is, “as much as you love yourself”
    or, “to the same degree that you love yourself.”
