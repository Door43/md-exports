To Canaan 04-05
=================


So **Abram** **obeyed** **God**. **He took** his wife, **Sarai**,
together with all of his **servants** and everything he owned and went
to the land **God showed him**, the **land of Canaan**.

Translation Notes:
------------------

-   **He took** – Some languages would say, “He brought”
here. Others
    would use two different verbs here, such as, “He caused his wife
    to come with him” and, “He brought along all of their servants
    and possessions.”
-   **God showed him** - Somehow God made it clear to Abram where he was
    to go. The text doesn't tell how God showed him.
-   **land of Canaan** - The name of this land was “Canaan”. This
could
    be translated, “the land called Canaan.”
