God's Covenant 04-09
======================


Then **God** made a **covenant** with **Abram**. A covenant is an
agreement between **two parties**. God said, “I will give you a
**son from your own body**. I give the land of **Canaan** to your
**descendants**.” But Abram still **did not have a son**.

*A Bible story from: Genesis 11-15*

Translation Notes:
------------------

-   **two parties** - The parties could be two people, two groups of
    people, or a person and a group of people. In this case the agreement
    was between God and Abram.
-   **from your own body** - With his own body Abram would cause his
    wife to become pregnant, so that together they would have their own,
    natural son. This was an amazing promise, since Abram and Sarai were
    very old.
-   **did not have a son** - Abram still did not have any descendants
    who could possess the land.
-   *A Bible story from* - These references may be slightly different in
    some Bible translations.
