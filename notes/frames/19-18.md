The Message of the Prophets 19-18
===================================


The **prophets continued to speak for God** even though the people
hated them. They warned people that God would destroy them if they did
not **repent**.  They also reminded people **of the promise that God’s
Messiah would come**.

*A Bible story from: 1 Kings 16-18; 2 Kings 5; Jeremiah 38*
