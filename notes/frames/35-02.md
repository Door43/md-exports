The Religious Leaders Grumbled 35-02
======================================


Some **religious leaders** who were also there saw **Jesus** treating
these **sinners** as friends, and they began to criticize him to each
other. So Jesus told them this **story**.

Translation Notes:
------------------

-   **story** - Jesus used this story to teach truths about God's
    kingdom. It is not clear if the events actually happened or not. If
    your language has a term that includes both fictional and real
    stories, you should use it here.
