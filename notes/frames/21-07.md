The Perfect High Priest 21-07
===============================


**Israelite** **priests** made **sacrifices** to **God on behalf of** the
people **as a substitute for the punishment for their sins**. Priests also
**prayed** to God for the people. The **Messiah** would be the **perfect
high priest** who would **offer himself** as a **perfect sacrifice**
to God.

Translation Notes:
------------------

-   **on behalf of** - This may be translated as, “for the benefit of”
    or, “in the place of.”
-   **as a substitute for the punishment for their sins** - God allowed
    people to bring animals to sacrifice for their sin as a reminder
    of the punishment that they deserved and their dependence on God
    to remove their sin. God accepted these sacrifices as a temporary
    covering for sin and did not punish the people for it.
-   **perfect high priest** - Unlike the other high priests, the Messiah
    would never sin, and he would permanently take away all the sins of
    the people.
-   **offer himself** – That is, “allow himself to be killed.” -
**perfect sacrifice** - That is, “a sacrifice that has no fault or
    imperfection.”
