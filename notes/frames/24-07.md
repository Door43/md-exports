John Baptized Jesus 24-07
===========================


**John** said to **Jesus**, “**I am not worthy to baptize you**.
You should baptize me instead.” But Jesus said, “You should baptize
me, because **it is the right thing to do**.” So John baptized him,
even though Jesus had never **sinned**.

Translation Notes:
------------------

-   **I am not worthy to baptize you** - This could be translated as, “I
    am not good enough to baptize you” or, “I am sinful, so I should
    not baptize you.”
-   **it is the right thing to do** - This might also be translated as,
    “it is the proper thing to do” or, “this is what God wants me
    to do.”
