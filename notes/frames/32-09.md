The Man Was Healed 32-09
==========================


When the people who took care of the pigs saw **what happened**, they
ran into the town and told everyone that they met what **Jesus** had
done. The people from the town came and saw the man **who used to have
the demons**. He was sitting calmly, wearing clothes, and acting like
a normal person.

Translation Notes:
------------------

-   **what happened** - That is, “how Jesus sent the demons out of the
    man and into the pigs.”
-   **who used to have the demons** – That is, “in whom the demons had
    lived” or, “who had been controlled by the evil spirits.”
