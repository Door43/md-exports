The Water Became Blood 10-03
==============================


**God turned the Nile River into blood**, but **Pharaoh** still would
not let the **Israelites** go.

Translation Notes:
------------------

-   **turned the Nile River into blood** - Some languages may need to
    say, “turned the water in the Nile River into blood.” Instead of
    water in the river there was blood, so the fish died and the people
    had no water to drink.
