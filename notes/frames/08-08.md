Joseph Ruled Egypt 08-08
==========================


**Pharaoh** was so **impressed with Joseph** that he appointed him to
be the **second most powerful man** in all of **Egypt**!

Translation Notes:
------------------

-   **impressed with** - Pharaoh was amazed by Joseph's wisdom and felt
    respect for him; he trusted Joseph to make wise decisions that
    would benefit the people. It may be clearer to say, “impressed
    with Joseph's wisdom.”
-   **second most powerful man** - Pharaoh made Joseph a very powerful
    and important ruler over all of Egypt. Only Pharaoh was more powerful
    and important than Joseph.
