The Midianite's Dream 16-11
=============================


That night **God** told **Gideon**, “**Go down** to the **Midianite**
camp and when you hear what they say, you will **no longer be afraid**.”
So that night, Gideon went down to the camp and heard a Midianite soldier
telling his friend about **something he had dreamed**. The man’s friend
said, “This dream means that Gideon's army will defeat the Midianite
army!” When Gideon heard this, he **worshiped** God.

Translation Notes:
------------------

-   **Go down** - The Midianite soldiers were camping out in a valley
    and were at a lower elevation than the Israelite soldiers.
-   **you will no longer be afraid** – That is, “you will stop being
    afraid.”
-   **something he had dreamed** – That is, “something he had seen
in a
    dream” or, “a dream he had had.”
