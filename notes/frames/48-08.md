The Lamb of God 48-08
=======================


When **God** told **Abraham** to offer his **son**, **Isaac**, as a
**sacrifice**, God provided a **lamb** for the sacrifice **instead of his
son, Isaac**. We all **deserve to die** for our **sins**! But God provided
**Jesus**, the **Lamb of God**, as a sacrifice **to die in our place**.

Translation Notes:
------------------

-   **instead of his son, Isaac** - This can also be translated as, “in
    the place of his son, Isaac” or, “in his son Isaac's place” or,
    “so that he would not have to offer his son Isaac as a sacrifice.”
-   **deserve to die** - That is, “should die.” -   **to die in our
place** - This can also be translated as, “to die in
    the place of each of us” or, “so that he would not have to
    kill us.”
