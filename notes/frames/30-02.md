The Crowd Followed Jesus 30-02
================================


But there were many people who saw **Jesus** and the **disciples**
**leave in the boat**. These people ran along the shore of the lake to
get to the other side ahead of them. So when Jesus and the disciples
**arrived**, a large group of people was already there, waiting for them.

Translation Notes:
------------------

-   **leave in the boat** - Some languages may need to add, “to cross
    the lake.”
-   **arrived** - That is, “got to the other side of the lake” or,
“got
    there.”
