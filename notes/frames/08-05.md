Joseph in Prison 08-05
========================


His master’s wife **tried to sleep with Joseph**, but Joseph refused to
**sin against God** in this way. She became angry and falsely accused
Joseph so that he was arrested and sent to prison. Even in prison,
Joseph **remained faithful to God**, and God **blessed** him.

Translation Notes:
------------------

-   **tried to sleep with Joseph** – Another way to say this would be,
    “tried to seduce Joseph to have sex with her.” To “sleep with”
    is a way of expressing this in order not to be crude or offensive.
-   **sin against God** - It is against God's law for people to have sex
    if they are not married to each other. Joseph did not want to sin
    by disobeying God's law.
-   **remained faithful to God** - Another way to say this would be,
    “continued to obey God.”
