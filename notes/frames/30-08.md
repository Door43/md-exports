Everyone Ate 30-08
====================


Then **Jesus** **broke the bread and the fish** into pieces. He gave the
pieces to his **disciples** to give to the people. The disciples kept
passing out the food, and **it never ran out**! All the people ate and
**were satisfied**.

Translation Notes:
------------------

-   **broke the bread and the fish** - That is, “tore the bread and the
    fish.”
-   **it never ran out** – Another way to say this would be, “there
was
    always more left.”
-   **were satisfied** – That is, “were no longer hungry” or,
“were not
    hungry any more.”
