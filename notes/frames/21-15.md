At the Perfect Time 21-15
===========================


**God** revealed to the **prophets** many things about the **Messiah**,
but the Messiah did not come during the time of any of those prophets.
More than 400 years after the last of these prophecies was given, at
exactly the right time, God would send the Messiah **into the world**.

    the world.” The Messiah would be sent not only to the Jews, but
    to all people.
