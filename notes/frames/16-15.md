An Offering for Gideon 16-15
==============================


The people wanted to make **Gideon** their **king**. Gideon **did not
allow them to do this**, **but he asked them** for some of the gold
rings that each of them had taken from the **Midianites**. The people
gave Gideon a large amount of gold.

Translation Notes:
------------------

-   **did not allow them to do this** - Gideon knew that it was better
    for the Israelites to have God as their king.
-   **but he asked them** – This phrase starts with “but” because
what
    he did next was not wise.
