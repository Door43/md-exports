Rebekah Was Childless 06-04
=============================


After a long time, **Abraham** died and all of **the promises that God
had made to him in the covenant were passed on** to **Isaac**. God had
promised that Abraham would have **countless descendants**, but Isaac's
wife, **Rebekah**, could not have children.

Translation Notes:
------------------

-   **the promises … were passed on** - The promises of the covenant
    that God made with Abraham were not for him only, but also for
    his descendants.
-   **countless** - This could also be translated as, “very many.” The
    word “countless” means there would be so many descendants that
    people would not be able to count them.
