Judas Made a Deal 38-02
=========================


One of **Jesus'** **disciples** was a man named **Judas**. Judas was
**in charge of the apostles' moneybag**, but he **loved money** and
often stole money out of the bag. After Jesus and the disciples arrived
in **Jerusalem**, Judas went to the **Jewish leaders** and offered to
**betray** Jesus to them in exchange for money. He knew that the Jewish
leaders denied that Jesus was the **Messiah** and that they were plotting
to kill him.

Translation Notes:
------------------

-   **in charge of the apostles’ moneybag** - That is, “responsible to
    hold the apostles' money” or, “responsible to hold the bag that
    had the disciples' money in it and to distribute funds from it.”
-   **loved money** – That is, “highly valued money” or, “wanted
money.”
    Some languages would not use the same word that can be used for
    “loved people.”
