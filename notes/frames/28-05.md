Not Willing to Obey 28-05
===========================


When the young man **heard what Jesus said**, he became very sad,
because he was very rich and did not want to give away all the things
he possessed. He turned and went away from Jesus.

Translation Notes:
------------------

-   **heard what Jesus said** – That is, “heard Jesus tell him to give
    away what he owned.”
