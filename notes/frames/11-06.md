Death of the Firstborn 11-06
==============================


But the **Egyptians** **did not believe God or obey his commands**. So
God **did not pass over** their houses. God killed every one of the
Egyptians' firstborn sons.

Translation Notes:
------------------

-   **did not believe God or obey his commands** – In some languages it
    may be more natural or clear to say, “did not believe God and so
    they did not obey his commands.”
-   **did not pass over** - He did not pass by their houses. Rather he
    stopped at each house and killed their eldest son.
