The Women 41-03
=================


The day after **Jesus** was buried was a **Sabbath** day, and **the Jews
were not permitted** to go to a **tomb** on that day. So very early
on the morning after the Sabbath day, several women prepared to go to
Jesus’ **tomb** to put more **burial spices** on his body.

Translation Notes:
------------------

-   **the Jews were not permitted** – The Sabbath day rules did not
    permit a Jew to walk very far or to do any other kind of work.
-   **burial spices** - This refers to sweet-smelling spices that were
    placed on a dead body to cover the bad smell. This can also be
    translated as, “sweet-smelling spices” or, “sweet-smelling
    oils” or, “sweet-smelling plants.”
