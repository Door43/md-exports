Birth of Isaac 05-05
======================


That day **Abraham** **circumcised** **all the males in his
household**. About a year later, when Abraham was 100 years old and
**Sarah** was 90, Sarah gave birth to Abraham's **son**. They named him
**Isaac** as **God** had told them to do.

Translation Notes:
------------------

-   **all the males in his household** - This means all of the men and
    boys that Abraham was responsible for, including his male servants,
    young and old.
