Not Able to Repay 29-03
=========================


“Since the **servant** could not **pay the debt**, the **king** said,
‘Sell this man and his family as **slaves** **to make payment on his
debt**.’”

Translation Notes:
------------------

- -   **pay the debt** - That is, “pay back the money he owed to the
    king.”
-   **to make payment on his debt** - This could be translated as, “and
    use the money received from selling them to pay part of what he
    owes me.”
