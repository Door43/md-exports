The Two Spies 15-01
=====================


**At last it was time for** the **Israelites** to **enter Canaan**, the
**Promised Land**.  **Joshua** sent **two spies to the Canaanite city
of Jericho** that was **protected by strong walls**. In that city there
lived a prostitute named **Rahab** who hid the spies and later helped
them to **escape**. She did this because she **believed** **God**. They
**promised** to protect Rahab and **her family** when the Israelites
would destroy Jericho.

Translation Notes:
------------------

-   **At last it was time for** - “At last” means “finally” or,
“after a
    long wait.” To make it clear what “time” refers to, you
    could say, “after they had wandered in the desert for 40 years,
    God finally permitted.”
-   **two spies to the Canaanite city of Jericho** - This could be
    translated as, “two men to Jericho, a city in Canaan, to find
    out information about it.” Also see the notes for, “spy out the
    land” in
-   **protected by strong walls** - This could be translated as,
    “completely surrounded by thick, strong walls made of stone to
    protect it from their enemies.”
-   **escape** – It is also possible to add, “escape from people in
    Jericho who wanted to harm them.”
-   **her family** - Rahab asked for protection for her father, mother,
    brothers, and sisters. Use your word for family that includes
    these people.
