The Blessing 05-10
====================


Then **God** said to **Abraham**, “Because you were willing to give me
everything, even **your only son**, I **promise** to **bless** you. Your
**descendants** will be more than the stars in the sky. Because you
have **obeyed** me, **all the families of the world** will be **blessed
through your family**.”

*A Bible story from: Genesis 16-22*

Translation Notes:
------------------

-   **your only son** - See explanation in -   **the stars in the sky**
- See explanation in -   **all the families of the world** - Here,
“families” refers to the
    larger distinct groups of people on earth, rather than to each set
    of parents and children.
-   **blessed through your family** - Here, “family” refers to
the many
    descendants that Abraham would have. The future generations of the
    world would be blessed through Abraham's descendants. The greatest
    blessing would come many generations later through God's chosen
    servant, the Messiah.
-   *A Bible story from* - These references may be slightly different in
    some Bible translations.
