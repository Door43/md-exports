The Religious Leader's Prayer 34-07
=====================================


“**The religious leader prayed like this**, ‘Thank you, **God**,
that **I am not a sinner like** other men—such as robbers, **unjust
men**, **adulterers**, or even like that **tax collector**.’”

Translation Notes:
------------------

- -   **The religious leader prayed like this** - Another way to say this
    would be, “This is how the religious leader prayed” or, “The
    religious leader prayed in this way.”
-   **I am not a sinner like** - That is, “I am not sinful like”
or, “I
    am righteous, not like.”
-   **unjust men** - That is, “men who are not righteous” or,
“people
    who do evil things” or, “law breakers.”
