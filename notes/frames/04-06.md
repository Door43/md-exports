God Blessed Abram 04-06
=========================


When **Abram** arrived in **Canaan**, **God** said, “Look all around
you. I will give to you and your **descendants all the land that you
can see as an inheritance**”. **Then Abram settled in the land**.

Translation Notes:
------------------

-   **all the land that you can see** - If Abram was standing on a
    mountain, he could have seen a very large area. On several occasions
    God promised to give the entire land of Canaan to Abram and his
    descendants.
-   **as an inheritance** - God promised to give land to Abram and his
    descendants as a father gives land and possessions to his children.
-   **Then Abram settled in the land** - Abram lived there along with
    all those who had gone there with him.
