Philip Met the Ethiopian 45-09
================================


Philip asked the Ethiopian, “Do you understand what you are reading?”
The Ethiopian replied, “No. I cannot understand it unless someone
explains it to me. Please come and sit next to me. **Was Isaiah writing
about** himself or someone else?”

Translation Notes:
------------------

-   **Was Isaiah writing about** - This can also be translated as, “Was
    Isaiah referring to.”
