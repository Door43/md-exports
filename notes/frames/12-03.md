Pharaoh Changed His Mind 12-03
================================


**After a short time**, **Pharaoh** and his people **changed their
minds** and wanted the **Israelites** to be their **slaves** again.
**God** caused Pharaoh to be stubborn so that people would see he is
the One True God, and understand that he, Yahweh, is more powerful than
Pharaoh and his **gods**.

Translation Notes:
------------------

-   **After a short time** – Probably at least two days had gone by. For
    that to be clear, it may be translated as, “After a few days” or,
    “A few days after the Israelites left Egypt.”
-   **changed their minds** - This phrase means, “began to think
    differently than they had before.” Some languages may not have
    this same expression, and will express the meaning in a direct way.
