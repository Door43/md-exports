You Crucified Jesus 43-06
===========================


“**Men of Israel**, **Jesus** was a man who did many mighty **signs
and wonders** by the **power** of **God**, as you have seen and already
know. But **you crucified him!**”

Translation Notes:
------------------

- -   **Men of Israel** – For some languages it is better to say,
“People
    of Israel” for it to be clear that this included men and women. This
    could also be translated as, “My fellow people of Israel” or,
    “My fellow Jews” to make it clear that Peter was also a Jew and
    belonged to the “people of Israel.”
-   **you crucified him!** - This could also be translated as, “you
    caused him to be crucified” or, “because of you, he was
    crucified.” The Jews did not actually nail Jesus to the
    cross. However, the Jewish leaders caused him to be condemned and
    many of the people in the crowd had shouted for him to be crucified.
