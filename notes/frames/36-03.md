Moses and Elijah 36-03
========================


Then **Moses** and the prophet **Elijah** **appeared**. These men had
lived on the earth hundreds of years before this. They talked with
**Jesus** about **his death, which would soon happen** **in Jerusalem**.

Translation Notes:
------------------

-   **appeared** – It is also possible to say, “appeared out of
    nowhere.” They suddenly were there.
-   **his death, which would soon happen** - This could be translated
    as, “how he would soon die” or, “how he would soon be killed.”
-   **in Jerusalem** – Some languages may prefer to say, “in the
city of
    Jerusalem.”
