Rehoboam Became King 18-05
============================


After **Solomon** died, his son, **Rehoboam**, became **king**. Rehoboam
was a foolish man. All the people of the **nation of Israel** came
together to **confirm him as king**. They complained to Rehoboam that
Solomon had made them do a lot of hard work and pay a lot of taxes.

Translation Notes:
------------------

-   **confirm him as king** - That is, “tell him that they were glad he
    was king and that they would do what he said.”
