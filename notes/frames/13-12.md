The Golden Calf 13-12
=======================


**Aaron made a golden idol** in the shape of a calf.  The people began
to **wildly worship** the idol and make **sacrifices** to it! **God**
was very angry with them because of their **sin** and planned to destroy
them. But **Moses** **prayed** for them, and God **listened to his
prayer** and did not destroy them.

Translation Notes:
------------------

-   **made a golden idol** - Aaron took the things made of gold that the
    people had brought to him, melted them, combined them, and formed
    them into the shape of a calf.
-   **wildly worship** - The people were sinning by worshiping the idol
    and also by doing sinful things as they worshiped it.
-   **listened to his prayer** - God always hears prayer. In this
    situation, “listened” means that God agreed to do what Moses
    asked.
