Evil People Will Be Judged 50-10
==================================


“When the world ends, the **angels** will gather together all the
people **who belong to the devil** and throw them into **a raging fire**,
where they will cry and grind their teeth in terrible **suffering**. Then
**the righteous ones** will **shine like the sun** in the **kingdom**
of **God their Father**.”
