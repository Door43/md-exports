The Son Repented 35-06
========================


“Finally, the younger son said to himself, ‘**What am I doing?**
All my father’s **servants** have plenty to eat, and yet here I
am starving. I will go back to my father and ask to be one of his
servants.’”

Translation Notes:
------------------

- -   **What am I doing?** - That is, “Why am I living like this?”
or, ” I
    should not be living like this!” or, “It doesn't make sense for
    me to live like this.” The son isn't really asking a question,
    so some languages will have to translate this as a statement.
