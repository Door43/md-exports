God's Word Gives Life 25-03
=============================


**Jesus** replied, “It is written in **God’s word,** ‘People do
not only need **bread** in order to live, **but they need every word
that God speaks!**’”

Translation Notes:
------------------

-   **bread** – Make sure that you use the same word to translate
    “bread” here as you did in
-   **but they need every word that God speaks!** - Another way to
    translate this would be, “Rather, people need to listen to and
    obey everything God says” or, “Rather, people have real life by
    believing and obeying what God says.”
