Enemies of God 48-03
======================


Because **Adam** and **Eve** **sinned**, something **even more terrible**
happened. They became enemies of **God**. As a result, every person
since then has been born with a sinful nature and is also an enemy
of God. The relationship between God and people was broken by sin.
But God had a plan to restore that relationship.

Translation Notes:
------------------

-   **even more terrible** - That is, “much worse” or, “worse
yet.”
