God's Promise to David 17-07
==============================


But **God** sent **the prophet Nathan** to **David** with this message,
“Because you are a **man of war**, you will not build **this Temple**
for me. Your **son** will build it. But, I will **bless** you greatly.
Someone from your family will always rule as **king** of **Israel**,
and the **Messiah** will be one of your **descendants**!” The Messiah
was God’s Chosen One who would save people of the world from **sin**.

Translation Notes:
------------------

-   **the prophet Nathan** – It may be more natural in some languages to
    say, “a prophet named Nathan.”
-   **man of war** - That is, “man who fights battles.” David killed
    many, many people in battle against the Israelites' enemies. God
    wasn't punishing David, but God wanted a man of peace to build the
    Temple where people would worship him.
-   **this Temple** - That is, “this building for worship” or, “this
    place of worship.”
-   **from sin** - That is, “from the terrible consequences of their
    sin.”
