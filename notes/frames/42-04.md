Breaking the Bread 42-04
==========================


The two men invited **Jesus** to stay with them, so he did. When they
were ready to eat the evening meal, Jesus picked up a loaf of bread,
thanked **God** for it, and then broke it. Suddenly, they recognized that
he was Jesus.  But at that moment, **he disappeared from their sight**.

Translation Notes:
------------------

-   **he disappeared from their sight** - This could also be translated
    as, “he was gone” or, “he was no longer there.”
