The Famine 08-10
==================


**The famine was severe** not only in **Egypt**, but also in **Canaan**
where **Jacob** and his family lived.

Translation Notes:
------------------

-   **Egypt, but also Canaan** – For some languages it may be clearer or
    more natural to say, “the country of Egypt, but also the land
    of Canaan.”
-   **The famine was severe** - The famine was very bad. There was very
    little food and many people outside of Egypt were starving.
