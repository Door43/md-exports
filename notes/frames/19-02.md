Elijah Rebuked Ahab 19-02
===========================


**Elijah** was a **prophet** when **Ahab** was **king** over the
**kingdom of Israel**.  Ahab was an **evil** man who encouraged people
to **worship** a false **god** named **Baal**. Elijah said to Ahab,
“There will be no rain or dew in the kingdom of Israel **until I say
so**.” **This made Ahab very angry**.

Translation Notes:
------------------

-   **until I say so** - This may be translated as, “until I command the
    rain and dew to come again.”
-   **This made Ahab very angry** – This could be translated as, “When
    Ahab heard what Elijah said, he became very angry.”
