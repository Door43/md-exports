The Death of Moses 14-15
==========================


Then **God** told **Moses** to go to the top of a mountain so he could
see the **Promised Land**. Moses saw the Promised Land but God did not
permit him to enter it. Then Moses died, and the **Israelites mourned
for thirty days**.  **Joshua** became their new leader. Joshua was a
good leader because he **trusted** and **obeyed** God.

*A Bible story from: Exodus 16-17; Numbers 10-14; 20; 27; Deuteronomy 34*
