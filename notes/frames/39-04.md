I Am the Son of God 39-04
===========================


**Jesus** said, “**I am**, and you will see me **seated with God
and coming from heaven**.” The **high priest** **tore his clothes in
anger** and shouted to the other **religious leaders**, “We do not need
any more **witnesses**! You have heard him say that he is the **Son of
God**. **What is your judgment**?”

Translation Notes:
------------------

-   **I am** - That is, “I am as you said” or, “I am the Messiah
and the
    Son of God.” “I am” is also the name of God (See By saying
    simply, “I am” Jesus was also saying that he is God. If possible,
    translate this so that people will see a similarity between Jesus'
    answer and the name of God.
-   **seated with God** - This could be translated as, “reigning with
    God.” Because God is the ruler over all, people talk about him
    as sitting on a throne in heaven. By saying that he would be seated
    with God, Jesus claimed that he had authority to rule with the Father.
-   **seated with God and coming from heaven** – This could be
    translated as, “sitting beside God and then coming from heaven.”
-   **tore his clothes in anger** - The Jews would tear their clothes to
    show grief or anger. If tearing the clothes means something else in
    your language, you may want to substitute a phrase such as, “he
    was extremely angry.”
-   **What is your judgment?** - That is, “What is your decision?” or,
    “Tell us what have you decided: Is he innocent or guilty?”
    The chief priest wanted the religious leaders to condemn Jesus for
    claiming to be equal with God.
