The Sacrifice 05-08
=====================


When they reached the place of **sacrifice**, **Abraham** tied up his
**son** **Isaac** and laid him on an **altar**. He was about to **kill his
son** when **God** said, “**Stop! Do not hurt the boy!** Now I know that
**you fear me** because you did not keep **your only son** from me.”

Translation Notes:
------------------

-   **kill his son** - God did not want human sacrifice. God wanted to
    see that Abraham loved God more than he loved his son and would obey
    God even when God told him to give his son back to God.
-   **Stop! Do no hurt the boy!** - God protected Isaac and kept Abraham
    from killing him.
-   **you fear me** - Abraham feared God, which included respect and
    reverence for God. Because of those things, he obeyed God.
-   **your only son** - Ishmael was also Abraham's son, but Isaac was
    the only son of Abraham and Sarah. God's covenant was with Isaac
    and it was through Isaac that God would fulfill his promise.
