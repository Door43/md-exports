Adam Was Alone 01-12
======================


Then **God** said, “It is **not good** for man to be **alone**.”
But none of the animals could be **Adam's helper**.

Translation Notes:
------------------

-   **not good** - This is the first time that anything in creation was
    not good. It means it was, “not yet good” because God was not
    finished with the creation of humans.
-   **alone** - Adam was the only human, with no possibility of a
    relationship with another person, and unable to reproduce children
    and multiply.
-   **Adam's helper** - There was no one who was similar enough to Adam
    to join with him to accomplish the task that God gave to him. None
    of the animals could do this.
