What Should We Do? 43-10
==========================


The people listening to **Peter** were **deeply moved by** the things
that he said. So they asked Peter and the **disciples**, “**Brothers**,
what should we do?”

Translation Notes:
------------------

-   **deeply moved by** - That is, “very troubled by” or, “felt
very sad
    when they heard.” To be “moved” is to feel strong emotions.
-   **Brothers** - This was a normal way for a Jew to address fellow
    Jews. It could also be translated as, “Friends.”
