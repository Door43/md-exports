Translation Notes:
------------------

-   **one day** - This phrase introduces an event that happened in the
    past, but does not state the specific time. Many languages have a
    similar way to begin telling a true story.
-   **turned to her** – That is, “turned around and looked at her.”
-   **In the name of Jesus** - That is, “by the authority of Jesus.”
    Because of Jesus' authority, Paul could command the demon to leave.
-   **come out of her** - That is, “leave her” or, “go away
from her.”
