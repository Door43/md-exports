Solomon Built the Temple 18-02
================================


In **Jerusalem**, **Solomon** built the **Temple** for which his father
**David** had planned and gathered materials. People now **worshiped**
**God** and offered **sacrifices** to him at the Temple instead of at
the **Tent of Meeting**.  God came and **was present in the Temple**,
and he lived there **with his people**.

Translation Notes:
------------------

-   **was present in the Temple** – That is, “was present in the
Temple
    in a special way.” Even though God was also present everywhere
    else at the same time, he made himself especially available to the
    people at the Temple.
-   **with his people** - This could be translated as, “in the midst of
    his people” or, “among his people.”
