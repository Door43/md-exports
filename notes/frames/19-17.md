Jeremiah Suffered for God 19-17
=================================


Most of the time, the people did not **obey** **God**. They often
mistreated the **prophets** and sometimes even killed them. Once,
the prophet **Jeremiah** was put into a **dry well** and left there
to die. He sank down into the mud that was in the bottom of the well,
but then the **king had mercy on him** and ordered his servants to pull
Jeremiah out of the well before he died.

Translation Notes:
------------------

-   **dry well** - The well did not currently have any water in it, but
    it did still have mud in the bottom. This could be translated as,
    “empty well.”
-   **had mercy on him** – This means he was kind to Jeremiah and helped
    him.
