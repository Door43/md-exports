How Many Times? 29-01
=======================


**One day**, **Peter** asked **Jesus**, “**Master**, how many times
should I **forgive** **my brother** when he **sins against me**? **Up
to** seven times?” Jesus said, “**Not seven times, but seventy times
seven!**” **By this, Jesus meant** that we should always forgive. Then
Jesus told **this story**.

Translation Notes:
------------------

-   **One day** - This phrase introduces an event that happened in the
    past, but does not state the specific time. Many languages have a
    similar way to begin telling a true story.
-   **my brother** - This term sometimes included people who were not
    actually siblings, but who shared another very strong connection
    such as religion, ethnic background, etc.
-   **sins against me** - This could also be translated as, “does
    something wrong against me.”
-   **Up to** - That is, “as many as.” -   **Not seven times, but
seventy times seven!** - This could be
    translated as, “You should not forgive only seven times, rather you
    should forgive seventy times seven times.” Jesus was not talking
    about an exact number. He was saying that we should forgive people
    every time they sin against us.
-   **By this, Jesus meant** – That is, “When Jesus said this he
meant.” -   **this story** - That is, “the following story.”
