Judah also Worshiped Idols 20-05
==================================


The people in the **kingdom of Judah** saw how **God** had **punished**
the people of the **kingdom of Israel** **for not believing and obeying
him**. But they still **worshiped** **idols**, including the **gods**
of the **Canaanites**. God sent **prophets** to **warn them**, but **they
refused to listen**.

Translation Notes:
------------------

-   **for not believing and obeying him** – Another way to translate
    this would be, “because they did not believe or obey him.”
-   **warn them** – That is, “tell them to stop sinning or terrible
    things would happen to them.”
-   **they refused to listen** - That is, “they refused to obey” or
    “they refused to stop their evil behavior.”
