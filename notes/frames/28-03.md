What Else Must I Do? 28-03
============================


But the young man said, “I have **obeyed** all these **laws** **ever
since I was a boy**. **What do I still need to do** in order to live
forever?” **Jesus** looked at him and **loved him**.

Translation Notes:
------------------

-   **ever since I was a boy** – Another way to say this would be,
“from
    the time I was a child until now.”
-   **What do I still need to do?** - That is, “What else do I need to
    do” or, “What do I need to do in addition to these?”
-   **loved him** - Jesus had compassion on him. Choose a word for love
    that is consistent with the kind of love God has for people.
