The Sinless Sacrifice 49-11
=============================


**Jesus** never **sinned**, but he chose to be **punished** and to **die**
as the perfect **sacrifice** to **take away** your sins and the sins of
every person in the world.  Because Jesus sacrificed himself, **God**
can **forgive** any sin, even terrible sins.

Translation Notes:
------------------

-   **take away** - That is, “remove the penalty of” or, “remove the
    punishment for.” The sacrifice of Jesus causes God to look at our
    sin as if it never existed.
