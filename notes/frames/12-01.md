Israel Left Egypt 12-01
=========================


The **Israelites** were very happy to leave **Egypt**. **They were no
longer slaves**, and they were **going** to the **Promised Land**! The
**Egyptians** gave the Israelites whatever they asked for, even gold
and silver and other valuable things. Some people from other nations
**believed** in **God** and went along with the Israelites as they
left Egypt.

Translation Notes:
------------------

-   **They were no longer slaves** - This could be translated as, “They
    were not slaves anymore.”
-   **going** – Some languages may use a more specific word like
    “traveling” since they would be going a long distance to the
    Promised Land.
-   **Promised Land** - This is the land that God had promised that he
    would give to Abraham's descendants.
