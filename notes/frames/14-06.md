Joshua and Caleb 14-06
========================


Immediately **Caleb** and **Joshua**, the other two spies, said, “It
is true that the **people of Canaan** are tall and strong, but **we can
certainly defeat them!  God will fight for us**!”

Translation Notes:
------------------

-   **people of Canaan** – This could be translated as, “the
people who
    live in Canaan” or, “the Canaanites.”
-   **we can certainly defeat them! God will fight for us** – To show
    the connection between these two statements, it may be necessary to
    say, “we can certainly defeat them because God will fight for us!”
-   **God will fight for us** – This could be translated as, “God will
    fight alongside us and help us defeat them!” This makes it clear
    that the Israelites would also be fighting against the Canaanites.
