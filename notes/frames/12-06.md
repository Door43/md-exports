Darkness over the Egyptians 12-06
===================================


Then **God** moved the **pillar of cloud** and placed it between the
**Israelites** and the **Egyptians** so the Egyptians **could not see**
the Israelites.

Translation Notes:
------------------

-   **pillar of cloud** â€“ See how you translated this phrase in -
**could not see** - The cloud pillar was so large and thick that the
    Egyptians could no longer see any of the Israelites.
