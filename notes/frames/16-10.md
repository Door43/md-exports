Too Many Soldiers 16-10
=========================


**32,000 Israelite soldiers came to Gideon**, but **God** told him
this was **too many**. So Gideon sent home 22,000 who were afraid to
fight. God told Gideon that he still had too many men. So Gideon sent
all of them home **except for 300 soldiers**.

Translation Notes:
------------------

-   **32,000 Israelite soldiers came to Gideon** - Some languages might
    need to insert the following sentence at the beginning of the
    story: “Gideon called the Israelites to come fight against the
    Midianites.” See
-   **too many** - This was more soldiers than God wanted for this
    fight. If that many solders fought and won, they would think that
    they won the battle with their own strength, and they would not know
    that God did it.
-   **except for 300 soldiers** - This sentence could be translated as,
    “So Gideon allowed only 300 men to stay, and the rest of the men
    went home.”
