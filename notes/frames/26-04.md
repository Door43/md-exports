The Prophesy about Jesus 26-04
================================


Then **Jesus** sat down.  Everybody watched him closely. They knew
the passage of **scripture** that he had just read referred to the
**Messiah**. Jesus said, “**The words I just read to you are happening
right now**.” All the people were **amazed**. “**Isn’t this the
son of Joseph**?” they said.

Translation Notes:
------------------

-   **The words I just read to you are happening right now** - Other
    ways to translate this would be, “The words you just heard me read
    are being fulfilled right now” or, “Today the words I read to
    you came true as you heard them.”
-   **amazed** - Translate the word “amazed” with a term that
means that
    they were surprised, shocked, and confused about how this could
    be possible.
-   **Isn't this the son of Joseph?** –This could also be translated as,
    “This man is only the son of Joseph!” or, “Everyone knows he is
    just Joseph's son!” The people were not asking if he was Joseph's
    son or not. They were wondering how he could be the Messiah since
    they thought he was only the son of an ordinary man.
