Jesus Is the Son of God 24-09
===============================


**God had told John**, “The **Holy Spirit** **will come down and rest
on** someone you **baptize**. That person is the **Son of God**.”
There is only one God. But John heard **God the Father** speak, and saw
**Jesus** the **Son** and the Holy Spirit when he baptized Jesus.

*A Bible story from: Matthew 3; Mark 1:9-11; Luke 3:1-23*
