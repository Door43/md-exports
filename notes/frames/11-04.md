The Passover Meal 11-04
=========================


The **Israelites** did everything just as **God** had commanded them to
do. In the middle of the night, God went throughout **Egypt** killing
**every firstborn son**.

Translation Notes:
------------------

-   **every firstborn son** - This means every firstborn son of families
    who had not made the blood sacrifice, that is, the Egyptians. To
    make this clear you may want to add, “Every Egyptian firstborn
    son” (since all the Israelite families had put the blood on their
    doorposts).
