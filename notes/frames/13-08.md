The Tent of Meeting 13-08
===========================


**God** also gave the **Israelites a detailed description** of a tent he
wanted them to make. **It was called** the **Tent of Meeting**, and it
had two rooms, separated by a large curtain. Only the **high priest**
was allowed to go into **the room behind the curtain**, because **God
lived there**.

Translation Notes:
------------------

-   **a detailed description** - This could be translated as, “God
    described it in detail” or, “God told them exactly how He wanted
    them to make it.”
-   **It was called** - This could be translated as, “They called it”
    or, “Moses called it.”
-   **the room behind the curtain** - This room was hidden by the
    curtain. Some languages would call this room, “the room in front
    of the curtain.”
-   **God lived there** - If this phrase would lead people to think that
    God was limited to living in the tent, here are some ways of
    translating it: “God was there” or, “God revealed Himself to
    humans there.”
