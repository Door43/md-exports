A Wife for Isaac 06-01
========================


When **Abraham** was very old, his **son**, **Isaac**, had grown to
be a man. So Abraham **sent one of his servants back** **to the land**
where his relatives lived **to bring back a wife for his son, Isaac**.

Translation Notes:
------------------

-   **sent one of his servants back** – This could be translated as,
    “told one of his servants to go back.” The word “back” means
    that the servant would be going to the same place where Abraham used
    to live long ago before he came to Canaan. Make sure the translation
    of this phrase makes that clear.
-   **to the land** - This land was east of where Abraham was now
    living.
-   **to bring back a wife for his son, Isaac** - This could be
    translated as, “to bring back an unmarried woman for his son,
    Isaac, to marry”.
