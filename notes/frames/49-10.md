Jesus Died in Our Place 49-10
===============================


**Because of your sin**, you are **guilty** and deserve to **die**.
**God should be angry** with you, but he **poured out his anger on**
**Jesus** instead of on you.  When Jesus died on the **cross**, he
**received your punishment**.

Translation Notes:
------------------

-   **Because of your sin** – This can also be translated as, “Because
    you have sinned.” To make it clear that this is talking about
    all people, for some languages it may be more clear to translate
    this as, “Because all people have sinned, they are guilty. They
    deserve death.”
-   **God should be angry** – This can also be translated as,
“It would
    be right for God to be angry.”
-   **poured out his anger on** - That is, “directed his anger at” or,
    “placed all of his anger upon” or, “was angry only with.”
-   **received your punishment** - This could also be translated as,
    “was punished instead of you” or, “was punished for your
    sin.” To make it clear that this applies to everyone, it could
    also be translated as, ”was punished for everyone's sin.”
