Your Will Be Done 38-12
=========================


**Jesus** **prayed** three times, “**My Father**, if it is possible,
please let me not have to **drink this cup of suffering**. But if there
is no other way for people’s **sins** to be **forgiven**, then **let
your will be done**.” Jesus was very troubled and **his sweat was like
drops of blood**.  **God** sent an **angel** to strengthen him.

Translation Notes:
------------------

-   **drink this cup of suffering** - That is, “go through this
    suffering” or, “suffer what is about to happen” or, “endure
    this suffering.”
-   **let your will be done** - This expression means, “do what you have
    planned” or, “do what needs to be done.”
