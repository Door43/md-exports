God's New Covenant 48-11
==========================


**God** made a **covenant** with **the Israelites, who were his chosen
people**. But God has now made a **New Covenant** that is available to
everyone. Because of this New Covenant, anyone from any **people group**
can become part of God’s people by **believing** in Jesus.

Translation Notes:
------------------

-   **the Israelites, who were his chosen people** - That is, “the
    Israelites, the people he had chosen” or, “his chosen people,
    the Israelites.”
