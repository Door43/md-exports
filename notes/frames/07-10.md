Translation Notes:

-   **lived peacefully** - This refers to the fact that Esau and Jacob
    were not angry at each other and did not fight with each other.
-   **buried him** - This could mean that they dug a hole in the ground,
    placed Isaac's body in it, and covered the hole with dirt or stones.
    Or it could mean that they placed Isaac's body in a cave and covered
    the opening.
-   **covenant promises** - These were the promises that God made in his
    covenant with Abraham.
-   **passed on from Isaac to Jacob** - The promises went from Abraham
