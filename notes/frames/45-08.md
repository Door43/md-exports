The Ethiopian Read Isaiah 45-08
=================================


When Philip **approached the chariot**, he heard the **Ethiopian**
reading from what the **prophet Isaiah** wrote. The man read, “They
led him like a **lamb** to be killed, and **as a lamb is silent**,
he did not say a word. They treated him unfairly and did not respect
him. **They took his life away from him**.”

Translation Notes:
------------------

-   **Ethiopian** - That is, a person from the country of Ethiopia. See
    note on
-   **approached the chariot** - That is, “got close to the chariot”
or,
    “came near to the chariot.”
-   **as a lamb is silent** - This could also be translated as, “like a
    lamb that is silent even when it is about to be killed.”
