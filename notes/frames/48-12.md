The Word of God 48-12
=======================


**Moses** was **a great prophet** who proclaimed the **word of God**. But
**Jesus** is **the greatest prophet** of all. He is the Word of God.

Translation Notes:
------------------

-   **a great prophet** - That is, “a very important prophet.” -
**the greatest prophet** - That is, “the most important prophet.” -
**He is the Word of God** - That is, “He is called the Word of God”
    because he reveals God's character. The other prophets preached the
    message God gave them, but Jesus revealed God in his preaching and
    his actions.
