The Earthquake 47-09
======================


Suddenly, there was a violent earthquake! All the prison doors **flew
open**, and the chains of all the prisoners **fell off**.

Translation Notes:
------------------

-   **flew open** - That is, “became unlocked and suddenly opened
wide.” -   **fell off** - That is, “suddenly came off” or,
“suddenly came apart
    so that the prisoners were released.”
