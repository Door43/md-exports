Back to Judea 37-02
=====================


After the two days had passed, **Jesus** said to his **disciples**,
“Let’s go back to **Judea**.” “But **Teacher**,” the disciples
answered, “Just a short time ago the people there wanted to kill
you!” Jesus said, “Our friend **Lazarus** **has fallen asleep,
and I must wake him**.”

Translation Notes:
------------------

-   **Judea** - This refers to the southern section of Israel, which was
    settled by the tribe of Judah. Some languages will prefer to say,
    “the region of Judea.”
-   **has fallen asleep, and I must wake him.** - Translate this phrase
    with the normal words for “asleep” and “wake” in your
    language.  Although Jesus was using these words with a different
    meaning, the disciples did not understand that yet.
