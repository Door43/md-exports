The Gnats and the Flies 10-05
===============================


So **God sent a plague** of **gnats**. Then he sent a plague of **flies**.
**Pharaoh** called **Moses** and **Aaron** and told them that if they
stopped the plague, the **Israelites** could leave Egypt. When Moses
prayed, God removed all the flies from **Egypt**. But Pharaoh **hardened
his heart** and would not let the people go free.

Translation Notes:
------------------

-   **God sent a plague** – This could be translated as, “God caused
    there to be a plague” or, “God caused a plague  to come over
    the land of Egypt.”
-   **gnats** - These were tiny, biting insects flying in large swarms,
    annoying and landing on all the people and animals of Egypt.
-   **flies** - These were much bigger flying insects that were both
    annoying and destructive. There were so many of these flies that
    they covered everything, even filling the Egyptians' houses.
-   **hardened his heart** - See note in
