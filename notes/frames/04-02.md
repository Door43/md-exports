The Tower 04-02
=================


They were very **proud**, and they did not care about what **God**
said. They even began building a **tall tower to reach heaven**. God
saw that if they all kept working together to do **evil**, they could
do many more **sinful** things.

Translation Notes:
------------------

-   **tall tower to reach heaven** - This structure was so tall that its
    top would be in the sky.
-   **heaven** – This could be translated as, “sky.”
