The Painful Sores 10-07
=========================


Then **God** told **Moses** to throw ashes into the air in front
of **Pharaoh**. When he did, painful skin sores appeared on the
**Egyptians**, but not on the **Israelites**. **God hardened Pharaoh's
heart**, and Pharaoh would not let the Israelites go free.

Translation Notes:
------------------

-   **God hardened Pharaoh's heart** - God caused Pharaoh to continue to
    be stubborn. See also note in
