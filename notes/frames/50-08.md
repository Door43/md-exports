The Field Is the World 50-08
==============================


The **disciples** did not understand the meaning of the story, so they
asked **Jesus** to explain it to them. Jesus said, “The man who planted
the **good** seed represents the **Messiah**. The field represents the
world. The good seed represents **the people of God’s kingdom**.”

Translation Notes:
------------------

-   **the people of God's kingdom** - This can also be translated as,
    “the people who live under God's authority” or, “the people
    who have submitted to God's rule” or, “the people who will live
    with God in his Kingdom.”
