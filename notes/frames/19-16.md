The Prophets Warned the People 19-16
======================================


**God** sent many other **prophets**. They all told the people to stop
**worshiping** **idols** and to **start showing justice and mercy**
to others. The prophets warned the people that if they did not stop
doing **evil** and start **obeying** God, then God would **judge**
them as **guilty**, and he would **punish** them.

Translation Notes:
------------------

-   **start showing justice and mercy** - This can be translated as,
    “start being just and merciful” or, “begin to demonstrate
    justice and mercy.”
