The Treasure in the Field 34-04
=================================


“The **kingdom of God** is also like **treasure** that someone hid in
a field. Another man found the treasure and then **buried it again**. He
was so **filled with joy** that he went and sold everything he had and
used the money to **buy that field**.”
