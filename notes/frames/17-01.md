Wicked King Saul 17-01
========================


**Saul** was the **first king of Israel**. He was tall and handsome,
just like the people wanted. Saul was a good king for the first few years
that he ruled over Israel. But then he became a wicked man who did not
**obey** **God**, so God chose a different man who would **one day be
king in his place**.

Translation Notes:
------------------

-   **first king of Israel** – This could be translated as, “first
king
    to rule over Israel.”
-   **one day** – This could be translated as, “some time in the
future”
    or “years later.”
-   **be king in his place** – Another way to say this would be, “take
    his place as king over Israel” or, “rule as king instead of
    him.”
