Jesus Went to Heaven 42-11
============================


Forty days after **Jesus** rose from the dead, he told his **disciples**,
“Stay in **Jerusalem** until my **Father** gives you **power** when the
**Holy Spirit** **comes on you**.” Then Jesus went up to **heaven**,
and **a cloud hid him from their sight**. Jesus sat down **at the right
hand of God** to rule **over all things**.
