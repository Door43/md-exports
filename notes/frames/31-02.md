The Storm 31-02
=================


**Meanwhile**, the **disciples** were **rowing their boat**, but by
late in the night they had only **reached** the middle of the lake. They
were rowing with **great difficulty** because the wind was blowing hard
against them.

Translation Notes:
------------------

-   **Meanwhile** - That is, “while Jesus was praying on the
    mountainside.”
-   **rowing their boat** - The boat had a sail, but it would not have
    worked when the wind was against them.
-   **reached** - This can also be translated as, “traveled as far
as.” -   **great difficulty** - That is, “much difficulty” or,
“a lot of
    difficulty.”
