The Locusts 10-10
===================


So **God** caused **swarms of locusts** to come over **Egypt**. These
**locusts** ate all the crops that the **hail** had not destroyed.

Translation Notes:
------------------

-   **swarms of locusts** - Locusts are grasshoppers that fly together
    in swarms, or large groups, and that can destroy large areas of all
    kinds of plants and food crops by eating them.
-   **hail** - Hail is like chunks of ice that fall down from the clouds
    as rain does.
