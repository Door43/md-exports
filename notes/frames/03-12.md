Dry Land 03-12
================


**Noah** **waited another week** and sent out the dove a third time. This
time, it found a place to rest and did not come back. The water was
drying up!

Translation Notes:
------------------

-   **waited another week** - You could say, “waited seven more days.”
    The word “waited” shows that Noah was allowing time for the
    floodwaters to go down before sending out the dove again.
