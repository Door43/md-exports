Pharaoh's Dream 08-06
=======================


After two years, **Joseph** was still in prison, even though he was
**innocent**. One night, the **Pharaoh**, which is what the **Egyptians**
called their **kings**, had two **dreams** that **disturbed him
greatly**. None of **his advisors** could tell him the **meaning of
the dreams**.

Translation Notes:
------------------

-   **disturbed him greatly** – This means that the king felt very
    afraid and confused .
-   **his advisors** - These were men with special powers and knowledge
    who could sometimes tell what dreams meant. Some translations refer
    to them as, “wise men.”
-   **meaning of the dreams** - People in Egypt believed that dreams
    were messages from the gods telling them about what would happen in
    the future. God used Pharaoh's dreams to tell him what would happen.
