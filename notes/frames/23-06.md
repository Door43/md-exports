The Angel and the Shepherds 23-06
===================================


That night, there were some **shepherds** in a nearby field **guarding
their flocks**. Suddenly, **a shining angel** appeared to them,
and **they were terrified**. The angel said, “**Do not be afraid**,
because I have some good news for you. The **Messiah**, the **Master**,
has been born in **Bethlehem**!”

Translation Notes:
------------------

-   **guarding their flocks** - A “flock” is a group of sheep. The
    shepherds were caring for their sheep, and protecting them from harm
    or theft.
-   **a shining angel** - This could also be translated as, “an angel
    surrounded by a bright light.” The shining light would have seemed
    even brighter in contrast to the darkness of the night.
-   **they were terrified** - The appearance of the supernatural angel
    was extremely frightening.
-   **Do not be afraid** - This often means, “stop being afraid.” The
    shepherds were very afraid when they saw the angel so he was telling
    them they did not need to be afraid.
