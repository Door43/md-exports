Stephen's Arrest 45-02
========================


**One day**, when Stephen was teaching about **Jesus**, some **Jews** who
did not believe in Jesus began to argue with Stephen. They became very
angry and lied about Stephen to the **religious leaders**.  They said,
“We heard him speak **evil** things about **Moses** and **God**!”
So the religious leaders arrested Stephen and brought him to the **high
priest** and the other leaders of the Jews, where more false **witnesses**
lied about Stephen.
