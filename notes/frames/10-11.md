The Darkness 10-11
====================


Then **God sent darkness that lasted for three days**. It was so dark
that the **Egyptians** could not leave their houses. But there was light
where the **Israelites** lived.

Translation Notes:
------------------

-   **God sent darkness** - God caused darkness to cover or spread over
    most of Egypt. In other words, God took away the light from this
    part of Egypt.
-   **darkness that lasted for three days** - This darkness was darker
    than ordinary nighttime darkness, and it continued to be totally
    dark for three whole days.
