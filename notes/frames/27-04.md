Translation Notes:
------------------

-   (The cloud-like frame around this picture indicates that Jesus is
    telling a story, and not necessarily explaining a historical event.)
-   **law expert** - See how you translated this term in -   **from
Jerusalem to Jericho** – In some languages you could
    translate this as, “from the city of Jerusalem to the city of
    Jericho” or, “from Jerusalem City to Jericho City.”
