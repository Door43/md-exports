The Proud Will Be Humbled 34-10
=================================


Then **Jesus** said, “I tell you the **truth**, **God** heard the **tax
collector's** **prayer** and **declared him to be righteous**.  But he did
not like the **religious leader's** prayer. God **will humble** everyone
who is **proud**, and he will lift up whoever **humbles himself**.”

*A Bible story from: Matthew 13:31-33, 44-46; Mark 4:30-32; Luke 13:18-21;
18:9-14*

Translation Notes:
------------------

-   **declared him to be righteous** - That is, “considered him to be a
    righteous person.” Even though the tax collector was a sinner,
    God was merciful to him because of his humility and repentance.
-   **will humble** - This could also be translated as, “will give a
    lower status to” or, “will cause to not be important.” It
    could be translated figuratively as, “will bring down.”
-   **will lift up** - That is, “will give a higher position to” or,
    “will honor.”
-   **humbles himself** - That is, “chooses to behave in a humble way”
    or, “has a humble attitude about himself.”
-   *A Bible story from* - These references may be slightly different in
    some Bible translations.
