Stephen Was Stoned 45-04
==========================


When the **religious leaders** heard this, they were so angry that they
**covered their ears** and **yelled loudly**. They dragged Stephen out
of the city and threw stones at him in order to kill him.

Translation Notes:
------------------

-   **covered their ears** - This could also be translated as, “They put
    their hands over their ears.” This was to show that they did not
    want to hear what Stephen said.
-   **yelled loudly** - They were yelling in anger. Translate this in a
    way that communicates that they were very upset.
