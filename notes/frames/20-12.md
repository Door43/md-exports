Cyrus Sent Judah Home 20-12
=============================


The **Persian Empire** was strong but **merciful** to the people it
conquered. Shortly after **Cyrus** became king of the Persians, he
gave an order that any **Jew** who wanted **to return to Judah** could
leave Persia and go back to Judah. He even gave them money to rebuild
the **Temple**! So, after seventy years in **exile**, a small group of
Jews **returned** to the city of **Jerusalem** in Judah.

Translation Notes:
------------------

-   **Persian Empire** - See how you translated this term in -   **Cyrus**
- See how you translated his name in -   **Judah** - See the note about
Judah in -   **to return to Judah** - Since most of these Jews were
the children
    and grandchildren of those who left Judah, they had never lived in
    Judah before. In some languages it might be better to say “to go
    to Judah.”
-   **exile** - See how you translated this term in -   **returned**
– That is, “went back.” Some languages may prefer to
    say, “went” since most of these people had never been to
    Jerusalem.
