Peter and the Servant Girl 39-06
==================================


As **Peter** was waiting outside the house, a **servant girl** saw him
and said to him, “You also were with **Jesus**!” Peter **denied
it**. Later, another girl said the same thing, and **Peter denied it
again**. Finally, the people said, “We know that you were with Jesus
because you both **are from Galilee**.”

Translation Notes:
------------------

-   **denied it** - This can be translated as, “said that it was not
    true” or, “said that he was not with Jesus” or, “said,
    'No. That is not true.'”
-   **Peter denied it again** – This could be translated as, “Peter
    denied knowing Jesus a second time” or, “again Peter said he
    had not been with Jesus.”
-   **are from Galilee** - This could also be translated as, “are
    Galileans.” The people could tell from the way Jesus and Peter
    talked that they came from the region of Galilee.
