Translation Notes:
------------------

-   **Lazarus came out!** - Some languages should say, “Lazarus came out
    of the tomb!”
-   **grave clothes** - That is, “burial clothes.” This can also be
    translated as, “burial bandages” or, “strips of cloth.”
-   **because of this miracle** – That is, “because God had done this
    amazing miracle” or, “because Jesus had made Lazarus come alive
    again.”
