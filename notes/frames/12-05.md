God Will Fight for You 12-05
==============================


**Moses** told the **Israelites**, “**Stop being afraid**! **God will
fight for you today and save you**.” Then God told Moses, “Tell the
people to **move** toward the **Red Sea**.”

Translation Notes:
------------------

-   **God will fight for you today and save you** - Another way to say
    this would be, “Today God will defeat the Egyptians for you and
    keep them from harming you.”
-   **move** – Some languages will be more specific and say, “walk.”
