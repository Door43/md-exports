**God's** **prophets** also said that the **Messiah** would be a prophet,
a **priest**, and a **king**. A prophet is a person who hears the words
of God and then proclaims Godâ€™s words to the people. The Messiah that
God promised to send would be the **perfect prophet**.

    in obedience to God, giving every word God would speak to the
    people. He would present God perfectly to the people, helping them
    to know and understand God.
