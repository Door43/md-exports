You Will Have a Son 22-02
===========================


**The angel** said to **Zechariah**, “Your wife will have a son. You
will name him **John**. He will be **filled with the Holy Spirit**, and
will **prepare the people for the Messiah**!” Zechariah responded,
“My wife and I are too old to have children! How will I know this
will happen?”

Translation Notes:
------------------

-   **The angel** - This refers to the angel that came to Zechariah in -
**filled with the Holy Spirit** - That is, “controlled by the Holy
    Spirit” or, “given wisdom and power by the Holy Spirit.”
-   **How will I know this will happen?** - Another way to translate
    this would be, “How can I be sure that this will truly happen?”
