Jesus Explained the Prophets 42-03
====================================


Then **Jesus** explained to them what **God’s word** said about the
**Messiah**. He reminded them that the **prophets** said the Messiah
would **suffer** and be killed, but would **rise** again **on the third
day**. When they arrived at the town where the two men planned to stay,
**it was almost evening**.

Translation Notes:
------------------

-   **on the third day** - Some languages may prefer to say, “on the
    third day after his death.”
-   **it was almost evening** - This can also be translated as, “the day
    was ending” or, “the sun was going down” or, “it was starting
    to get dark.”
