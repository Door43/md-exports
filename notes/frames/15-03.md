Marching around Jericho 15-03
===============================


**After the people crossed the Jordan River**, **God** told **Joshua
how to attack** the powerful city of **Jericho**. The people **obeyed**
God. Just as God told them to do, the soldiers and **priests** marched
around the city of Jericho **once a day for six days**.

Translation Notes:
------------------

-   **After the people crossed the Jordan River** – In some languages it
    is better to say, “The people crossed the Jordan River and
    then…”
-   **how to attack** – This could be translated as, “exactly what he
    should do to attack.”
-   **once a day for six days** - That is, they went around the city one
    time every day for a total of six days.
