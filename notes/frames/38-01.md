The Passover 38-01
====================


Every year, the **Jews** celebrated the **Passover**. This was
a celebration of how **God** had **saved** their ancestors from
**slavery** in **Egypt** **many centuries earlier**. About three years
after **Jesus** first began **preaching** and teaching publicly, Jesus
told his **disciples** that he wanted to celebrate this Passover with
them in **Jerusalem**, and that he would be killed there.

Translation Notes:
------------------

-   **many centuries earlier** - That is, “hundreds of years earlier”
    or, “a very long time before.”
