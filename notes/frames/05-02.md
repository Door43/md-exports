Ishmael Was Born 05-02
========================


So **Abram married Hagar**. Hagar had a baby boy, and Abram named him
**Ishmael**. But **Sarai became jealous of Hagar**. When Ishmael was
thirteen years old, **God** again spoke to Abram.

Translation Notes:
------------------

-   **married** - Hagar became Abram's concubine–a “second wife” of
    lower status. Hagar was still Sarai's servant.
-   **became jealous of Hagar** - Sarai was jealous of Hagar because
    Hagar could have children and Sarai could not.
