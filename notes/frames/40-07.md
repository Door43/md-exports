Jesus Died 40-07
==================


Then **Jesus** cried out, “**It is finished!** **Father**, I give
my **spirit** **into your hands**.” Then he **bowed his head** and
**gave up his spirit**. When he **died**, there was an earthquake and the
**large curtain** that separated the people from the presence of **God**
in the **Temple** was torn in two, from the top to the bottom.

Translation Notes:

-   **It is finished!** - This could also be translated as, “It is
    completed” or, “I have finished it” or, “I have completed
    the work.” This means that Jesus' work of salvation was complete.
-   **into your hands** - That is, “into your care.” -   **bowed his
head** – That is, “lowered his head.” -   **gave up his spirit**
- That is, “gave up his spirit to God” or,
    “released his spirit to God and died.”
-   **large curtain** - This was a large, strong fabric hung in the
    temple. It was like a wall separating one room from another. It can
    also be translated as “thick curtain” or, “hanging fabric”
    or, “screen.”
