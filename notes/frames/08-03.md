The Brothers' Lie 08-03
=========================


Before **Joseph’s** brothers returned home, they tore Joseph’s
robe and dipped it in **goat's blood**. Then they showed the robe to
their father so he would think that a wild animal had killed Joseph.
**Jacob** was very sad.

Translation Notes:
------------------

-   **goat's blood** - The brothers wanted Jacob to think that the blood
    on the clothes was Joseph's blood.
