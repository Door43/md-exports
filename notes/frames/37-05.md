I Am the Resurrection 37-05
=============================


**Jesus** replied, “**I am the Resurrection and the Life**. Whoever
**believes** in me **will live, even though he dies**. Everyone who
believes in me **will never die**. Do you believe this?” **Martha**
answered, “Yes, **Master**! I believe you are the **Messiah**, the
**Son of God**.”

Translation Notes:
------------------

-   **I am the Resurrection and the Life** - This is one of several very
    powerful “I am” statements in which Jesus says something about
    his essential nature. In this one, Jesus indicated that he is the
    “provider” or, “source” of resurrection and life. If possible,
    translate this phrase in a way that makes it clear that this is his
    essential nature. This can also be translated as, “I am the one
    who resurrects people and causes them to live.”
-   **will live, even though he dies.** - That is, “will live forever,
    even if he dies.” The English word, “he” does not only refer
    to men.  Women who believe in Jesus will also live forever.
-   **Martha** - Martha was the sister of Lazarus and Mary. See -
**will never die** - This can also be translated as, “will live
    forever.”
