The Death of the Messiah 21-12
================================


The **prophets** also told about how the **Messiah** would **die**.
**Isaiah** **prophesied** that people would spit on, mock, and beat the
Messiah. They would **pierce** him and he would die in great suffering
and agony, even though he had not done anything wrong.

Translation Notes:
------------------

-   **pierce** - That is, “stab.” Sharp objects would penetrate
his body
    as part of the punishment for people's sin.
