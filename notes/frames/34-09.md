The Tax Collector's Prayer 34-09
==================================


“But the **tax collector** **stood far away** from the **religious
leader**, and **did not even look up to heaven**. Instead, **he pounded
on his chest with his fist** and **prayed**, ‘**God**, please be
**merciful** to me because I am a **sinner**.’”

Translation Notes:
------------------

- -   **stood far away** - This can also be translated as, “stood at a
    distance” or, “stayed separate.”
-   **did not even look up to heaven** - The word “even” indicates
that
    people normally looked up to heaven when praying to God, but that
    this man did not because he was so ashamed of his sin.
-   **he pounded on his chest with his fist** - This could also be
    translated as, “because of his grief, he hit his chest with his
    fist” or, “he pounded his chest in sorrow.” If people would
    find this hard to understand because they beat their chest for other
    reasons, you could translate this as, “he showed his despair.”
