The Wet Cloth 16-09
=====================


For the first **sign**, **Gideon** laid a cloth on the ground and asked
**God** to **let the morning dew fall** only on the cloth and not on the
ground.  **God did that**. The next night, he asked that the ground be
wet but the cloth dry. God did that too. These two signs convinced Gideon
that God would use him to **save** **Israel** from the **Midianites**.

Translation Notes:
------------------

-   **sign** - This could be translated as, “miracle” or,
“impossible
    thing.”
-   **let the morning dew fall** - This can be translated as, “make the
    morning dew appear” or, “make the morning dew come up.”
    “Dew” refers to the drops of water that appear on the ground in
    the morning. Dew naturally covers everything equally.
-   **God did that** - This could be translated as, “God did what Gideon
    asked him to do.”
