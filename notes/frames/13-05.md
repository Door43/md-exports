The Commandments 13-05
========================


“Do not make **idols** and do not **worship** them, because **I,
Yahweh, am a jealous God**. **Do not use my name in a disrespectful
way**. Be sure to keep the **Sabbath day** **holy**. That is, do all
your work in six days, for the **seventh day** is a day for you to rest
and **to remember me**.”

Translation Notes:
------------------

- -   **I, Yahweh, am a jealous God** - This could be translated as, “I,
    Yahweh, will be angry if you worship or honor anything besides
    me.” God strongly desires that his people love, serve, and obey
    Him more than anything or anyone else. He must be the only master
    of their lives.
-   **Do not use my name in a disrespectful way** - This could be
    translated as, “Do not talk about me in a way that does not show
    respect and honor” or, “Talk about me in a way that gives me
    proper respect and honor.”
-   **seventh day** - To translate this, it is best to use the number
     rather than give the name of a specific day of the week.
-   **to remember me** - This could be translated as, “to keep me in
    mind” or, “to honor me.”
