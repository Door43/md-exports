A New Pharaoh 09-02
=====================


After hundreds of years, the number of **Israelites** had become very
large. The **Egyptians** no longer remembered **Joseph** and all he had
done to help them. They became afraid of the Israelites because there
were so many of them. So the **Pharaoh** who was ruling Egypt at that
time **made the Israelites slaves** to the Egyptians.

Translation Notes:
------------------

-   **Pharaoh** – “Pharaoh” is an Egyptian word that refers to their
    king. This Pharaoh was probably the son of a former Pharaoh who had
    died, who may have been a descendant of the Pharaoh that Joseph knew.
-   **made the Israelites slaves** - That is, “forced the Israelites to
    do hard labor against their will and treated them very harshly.”
