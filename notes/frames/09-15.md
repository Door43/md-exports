Aaron Helped Moses 09-15
==========================


**Moses was afraid and did not want to go** to **Pharaoh** because he
thought he could not speak well, so **God** sent **Moses’ brother,
Aaron**, to help him. God warned Moses and Aaron that Pharaoh would
be **stubborn**.

*A Bible story from: Exodus 1-4*

Translation Notes:
------------------

-   **was afraid and did not want to go** - Moses knew that Pharaoh
    wanted to kill him, and he did not believe that he could do what
    God wanted him to do.
-   **Moses' brother, Aaron** - Aaron was Moses's actual brother from
    his Israelite mother and father. Aaron would have been at least
    several years older than Moses.
-   **stubborn** - This means the Pharaoh would refuse to obey God. You
    may also want to add, “stubborn and refuse to listen .”
-   *A Bible story from* - These references may be slightly different in
    some Bible translations.
