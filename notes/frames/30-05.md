Five Loaves and Two Fish 30-05
================================


But **Jesus** said to the **disciples**, “You give them something to
eat!” They responded, “**How can we do that?** We only have five
loaves of bread and two small fish.”

Translation Notes:
------------------

-   **How can we do that?** – This could be translated as, “We
cannot do
    that!” or, “It is impossible to do that!” The disciples were
    not asking an actual question. Rather, they were strongly expressing
    that they did not think this was possible.
