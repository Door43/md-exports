Israel Helped the Gibeonites 15-08
====================================


So **Joshua** gathered the **Israelite** army and they marched all night
**to reach the Gibeonites**. In the early morning **they surprised the
Amorite armies** and attacked them.

Translation Notes:
------------------

-   **to reach the Gibeonites** - That is, “to get to the Gibeonites”
    or, “to arrive at where the Gibeonites lived.” The Gibeonites
    lived in Canaan, but Canaan is big enough that it took all night
    for the Israelite army to travel from their camp to where the
    Gibeonites were.
-   **they surprised the Amorite armies** - The Amorites did not know
    that the Israelites were coming to attack them.
