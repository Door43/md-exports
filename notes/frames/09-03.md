Hard Labor 09-03
==================


The **Egyptians** forced the **Israelites** to build many buildings
and even whole cities. The hard work made their lives **miserable**,
but **God blessed them**, and they had even more children.

Translation Notes:
------------------

-   **miserable** â€“ This means that they suffered terribly because of
    how harshly they were treated and how hard they were forced to work.
    They also felt very discouraged.
-   **God blessed them** - God took care of them, helping them endure
    the severe treatment and even caused them to become more numerous
    by giving them children.
