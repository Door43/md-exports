The Power of Jesus 44-04
==========================


A crowd of people quickly came to see the man who was **healed**.
**Peter** said to them, “Why are you amazed that this man is healed? We
did not heal him through our own power or goodness. Rather, it is the
**power** of **Jesus** and the **faith** that Jesus gives that healed
this man.”
