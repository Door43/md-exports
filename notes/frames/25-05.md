Do Not Test God 25-05
=======================


But **Jesus** replied to **Satan** by quoting from the **Scriptures.**
He said, “**In God's Word, he commands his people, ‘Do not test the
Lord your God**.’”

Translation Notes:
------------------

-   **In God’s Word, he commands his people, ‘Do not test the Lord,
your
    God.’”** – This could be translated as an indirect quote: “God
    commands us in his Word that we should not test the Lord our God.”
-   **Do not test the Lord your God** - This could be translated as, “Do
    not make the Lord your God prove himself to you” or, “Do not
    make the Lord your God prove that he is good.”
-   **Lord your God** – That is, “Yahweh, your God” or, “Yahweh,
who is
    God and has authority over you.”
