David Praised God 17-08
=========================


When **David** heard **these words**, he immediately thanked and
**praised** **God** because he had **promised** David **this great
honor** and many **blessings**. David did not know when God would do
these things. But as it happened, the **Israelites** would have to wait
a long time before the **Messiah** came, almost 1,000 years.

Translation Notes:
------------------

-   **these words** - That is, “the words the prophet had just said.”
    This refers back to the promises in
-   **this great honor** - People who lived later would highly respect
    David because some of his descendants would be kings over Israel
    and one of them would be the Messiah.
