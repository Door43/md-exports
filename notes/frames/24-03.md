A Baptism of Repentance 24-03
===============================


When people heard **John's** message, many of them **repented from their
sins**, and John **baptized** them. Many **religious leaders** also
came to be baptized by John, but they **did not repent** or **confess
their sins**.

Translation Notes:
------------------

-   **repented from their sins** - This could also be translated as,
    “repented concerning their sins” or, “changed their minds
    about their sins” or, “turned away from their sins.”
-   **did not repent** - That is, “did not turn away from their sins.”
-   **confess their sins** - To confess is to acknowledge that something
    is true. These leaders did not want to acknowledge that they had
    sinned. This may be translated as, “confess that they had sinned.”
