One People 04-01
==================


**Many years after the flood**, there were **again many people** in the
world, and they all spoke the **same language**. Instead of filling
the earth as **God** had commanded, they gathered together and built
**a city**.

Translation Notes:
------------------

-   **many years after the flood** - Many generations had passed since
    the end of the flood.
-   **again many people** - Noah's family multiplied into enough people
    to fill a city.
-   **same language** - This means there was only one language, so they
    could all understand each other.
-   **a city** - It is best to use a general word for “city” since the
    text does not give a specific name.
