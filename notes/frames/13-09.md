The Altar 13-09
=================


Anyone who **disobeyed** **God's law** could bring an animal **to the
altar in front of the Tent of Meeting** as a **sacrifice** to **God**. A
**priest** would kill the animal and burn it on the **altar**. **The
blood of the animal that was sacrificed covered the person’s sin**
and made that person **clean in God's sight**. God chose **Moses'**
brother, **Aaron**, and Aaron's **descendants** to be his priests.

Translation Notes:
------------------

-   **God's law** - This refers to all the commandments and instructions
    that God had told the Israelites to obey.
-   **to the Tent of Meeting** - They did not bring the animal inside
    the Tent of Meeting, but to the altar in front of the Tent of
    Meeting. Be sure not to use an expression that means that they
    brought it inside.
-   **covered the person’s sin** - When people brought animals to
    sacrifice, God chose to see the blood of the animals as a covering
    over their sin. This is like hiding something that is ugly or dirty
    by covering it.
-   **clean in God's sight** - This could be translated as, “as if he
    did not have the sin according to God” or, “free of the punishment
    for breaking God's law.”
