The House of the High Priest 39-01
====================================


It was now **the middle of the night**. The soldiers led **Jesus**
to the house of the **high priest** in order for the high priest **to
question him**.  **Peter** followed far behind them. When Jesus was
taken into the house, Peter stayed outside and warmed himself by a fire.

Translation Notes:
------------------

-   **the middle of the night** - This expression means, “halfway
    through the night” or, “very late at night.”
-   **to question him** – That is, “to ask Jesus questions to try to
    find something they could accuse Jesus of doing wrong.”
