Firstborn Males Would Die 11-01
=================================


**God** warned **Pharaoh** that if he did not let the **Israelites**
go, then he would kill all the **firstborn males of both people and
animals**. When Pharaoh heard this he still refused to **believe**
and **obey** God.

Translation Notes:
------------------

-   **the firstborn males of both people and animals** - This could be
    translated as, “the eldest son in every family and the first male
    offspring of any of their animals.”
