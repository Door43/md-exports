The Ram 05-09
===============


Nearby **Abraham** saw **a ram** that was stuck in a bush.  **God had
provided the ram** to be the **sacrifice** instead of **Isaac**.
Abraham happily offered the ram as a sacrifice.

Translation Notes:
------------------

-   **a ram** - A ram is a male goat. Goats were one of the animals that
    people could sacrifice to God.
-   **God had provided the ram** - Just at the right moment, God caused
    the ram to be stuck in the bush.
