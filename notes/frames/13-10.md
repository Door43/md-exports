The People Sinned 13-10
=========================


The people all agreed to **obey** the laws that **God** had **given
them**, to **worship** only God, and to be **his special people**. But a
short time after they **promised** to obey God, they **sinned terribly**.

Translation Notes:
------------------

-   **given them** - This could be translated as, “told them to obey.”
-   **his special people** - From among all the nations, God had chosen
    the Israelites for his special purpose. This could be translated as
    “his special nation” or, “his own people” or, “the nation
    he chose to be his people.”
-   **a short time** – The people sinned during the forty days that
    Moses was on the mountain with God.
-   **sinned terribly** - They sinned in a way that was especially
    offensive to God. This could be translated as, “they sinned
    badly,” or “they did something that was very bad” or, “they
    did something bad that made God very angry.”
