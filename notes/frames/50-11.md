Dead Believers Will Rise Again 50-11
======================================


**Jesus** also said that he would return to earth just before the world
ends. He will come back the same way that **he left**, that is, he will
have a physical body and **will come on the clouds in the sky**. **When
Jesus returns**, every **Christian** who has **died** will **rise**
from the dead and **meet him in the sky**.

Translation Notes:
------------------

-   **he left** - This could also be translated as, “he left the
earth”
    or, “he left to go back to heaven.”
-   **will come on the clouds in the sky** - That is, “the clouds in the
    sky will surround him as he comes” or, “the clouds of the sky
    will carry him along.”
-   **when Jesus returns** - That is, “when Jesus returns to the
earth.” -   **meet him in the sky** - That is, “join him in the
sky.” Those who
    believe in Jesus will go up to be near Jesus while he is in the sky.
