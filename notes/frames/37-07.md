Open the Tomb 37-07
=====================


The **tomb** was a cave with a stone rolled in front of its opening. When
**Jesus** arrived at the tomb, **he told them**, “**Roll the
stone away**.” But **Martha** said, “**He has been dead for four
days**. There will be a bad smell.”

Translation Notes:
------------------

-   **he told them** - That is, “he told the men there.” He was
probably
    not telling Mary and Martha to roll the stone away.
-   **Roll the stone away** - Some languages may prefer to say, “Roll
    the stone away from the opening of the tomb.”
-   **Martha** - Martha was the sister of Lazarus and Mary. See -   **He
has been dead for four days** - This could also be translated
    as, “He died four days ago and his body is lying there.”
