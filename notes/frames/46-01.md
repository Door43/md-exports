Saul Arrested the Believers 46-01
===================================


**Saul** was the young man who **guarded the robes of the men who killed
Stephen**. He did not **believe** in **Jesus**, and so he **persecuted**
the **believers**. He went **from house to house** in **Jerusalem**
to arrest both men and women and to put them in prison. The **high
priest** gave Saul permission to go to the city of **Damascus** to arrest
Christians there and to bring them back to Jerusalem.

Translation Notes:
------------------

-   **guarded the robes of the men who killed Stephen** - See -   **from
house to house** - That is, “into many houses.” -   **Damascus** -
Damascus is now the capital of the country of Syria.
    During Saul's time, it was a city belonging to the Roman Empire.
    Most of the people there were not Jewish, but there were some Jews
    and also some Christians living there.
