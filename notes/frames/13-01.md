The Mountain at Sinai 13-01
=============================


After **God** led the **Israelites** through the **Red Sea**, he led
them through the wilderness to a mountain called **Sinai**. This was the
same mountain where **Moses** had seen the **burning bush**. The people
**set up their tents** at the **base of the mountain**.

Translation Notes:
------------------

-   **burning bush** - Before Moses returned to Egypt, God had spoken to
    him from a shrub that was on fire, but that was not burned up by
    the fire. See
-   **set up their tents** - The Israelites had to travel a great
    distance from Egypt to the Promised Land. So they took tents with them
    so that they could set them up as shelters and sleep in them along the
    way. Some languages could translate this as, “hung their tents.”
-   **base of the mountain** – This could be translated as, “bottom of
    the mountain.” This refers to the area of land that is located
    next to the place where the ground starts to slant upward to form
    a mountain.
