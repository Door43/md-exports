Paul and Silas in Philippi 47-01
==================================


As Saul traveled throughout the **Roman Empire**, **he began to use
his Roman name, ”Paul.”** One day, Paul and his friend **Silas**
went to the town of **Philippi** to **proclaim** the **good news**
about **Jesus**. They went to a place by the river outside the city
where people gathered to pray. There they met a woman named Lydia who
was a **merchant**. She **loved** and **worshiped** **God**.

Translation Notes:

-   **proclaim** - That is, “teach” or, “preach.” -   **merchant**
- This could also be translated as, “seller” or,
    “business owner.”
