An Angel Spoke to Mary 22-04
==============================


When **Elizabeth** was **six months pregnant**, the same **angel**
suddenly appeared to **Elizabeth’s relative**, whose name was
**Mary**. She was a **virgin** and **was engaged** to be married to a
man named **Joseph**. The angel said, “You will become pregnant and
give birth to a son. You are to name him **Jesus** and he will be the
**Messiah**.”

Translation Notes:
------------------

-   **six months pregnant** - Either she had already been pregnant for
    six months or she was in the sixth month of her pregnancy.
-   **pregnant** - Different languages have different idioms to talk
    about pregnancy, such as “she was with child” or, “she had one
    in her body” or, “she had belly.” Some languages have special
    ways of speaking about it politely, such as “she was expecting.”
    Use an expression that will not be embarrassing to readers.
-   **Elizabeth** - She was Zechariah's wife. An angel told Zechariah
    that Elizabeth would give birth to a son.
-   **Elizabeth’s relative** - Many translations say, “cousin”
here but
    we don't know exactly how these two women were related. A general
    term like, “relative,” “kin” or, “cousin” could be used.
-   **was engaged** - That is, “was promised.”
