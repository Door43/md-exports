The Second Temptation 25-04
=============================


Then **Satan** took **Jesus** to the highest point on the **Temple**
and said, “If you are the **Son of God**, **throw yourself down**,
because **it is written**, ‘**God** will command his **angels** to
carry you **so your foot does not hit a stone**.’”

Translation Notes:
------------------

-   **throw yourself down** - That is, “jump off this building to the
    ground.”
-   **it is written** – That is, “a prophet of God wrote long ago.”
-   **so your foot does not hit a stone** - This means, “so that you
    will not be hurt at all; not even your foot will be injured on a
    stone.” It could also be translated as, “so that even your foot
    will not strike against a stone; you will not be injured at all.”
