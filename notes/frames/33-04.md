The Seed in the Thorns 33-04
==============================


“Still other seeds fell among thorn bushes. Those seeds began to grow,
but **the thorns** **choked them out**. So the plants that grew from
the seeds in the **thorny ground** did not produce any grain.”

Translation Notes:
------------------

- -   **the thorns** – That is, “the thorn plants” or, “the
thorn bushes.” -   **choked them out** - This can also be translated
as, “overshadowed
    them” or, “crowded them out.”
-   **thorny ground** - That is, “ground that was covered with thorny
    bushes.”
