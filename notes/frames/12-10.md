God Fought for Israel 12-10
=============================


So they followed the **Israelites** onto the **path through the sea**,
but **God** caused the **Egyptians** **to panic** and caused their
**chariots** to **get stuck**. They shouted, “Run away! God is fighting
for the Israelites!”

Translation Notes:
------------------

-   **path through the sea** - This was the dry strip of land across the
    bottom of the sea, with a wall of water on each side.
-   **to panic** – This could be translated as, “to get fearful and
    confused.”
-   **get stuck** - The chariots could no longer move.
