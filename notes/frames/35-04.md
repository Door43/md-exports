The Younger Son 35-04
=======================


“Soon the younger son gathered all that he had and went far away and
**wasted his money** in **sinful living**.”

Translation Notes:
------------------

- -   **wasted his money** - That is, “spent all his money without
getting
    anything of value in exchange.” In some languages it can be
    translated as, “threw his money away” or, “ate all his money.”
-   **sinful living** - That is, “doing sinful things.”
