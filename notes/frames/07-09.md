Jacob Met Esau 07-09
======================


**Jacob** was very afraid because he thought **Esau** still wanted
to kill him. So he sent many herds of animals to Esau as a gift. The
**servants** who brought the animals said to Esau, “**Your servant,
Jacob**, is giving you these animals. He is coming soon.”

Translation Notes:
------------------

-   **your servant, Jacob** - Jacob was not actually Esau's servant. But
    Jacob told his servants to say this because he wanted to show Esau
    that he was coming to him humbly and respectfully, so that Esau
    would no longer be angry with him.
