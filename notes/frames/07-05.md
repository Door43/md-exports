Esau Hated Jacob 07-05
========================


**Esau** hated **Jacob** because Jacob had stolen his **rights as oldest
son** and also **his blessing**. So he planned to kill Jacob after their
father died.

Translation Notes:
------------------

-   **rights as oldest son** - Jacob found a way to get the larger
    portion of their father's wealth that should have gone to Esau as
    the older son. See also note on
-   **his blessing** - Jacob also tricked their father into giving him
    the promise of extra prosperity that Isaac intended to give to Esau.
