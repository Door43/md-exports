Jesus in Nazareth 26-02
=========================


**Jesus** went to the town of **Nazareth** where he had lived during
his childhood. On the **Sabbath**, he went to the **place of worship**
so that he would read from it. They handed him the **scroll of the
prophet Isaiah**. Jesus **opened up the scroll** and read part of it to
the people.
