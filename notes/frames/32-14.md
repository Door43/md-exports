The Woman Was Healed 32-14
============================


She had heard that **Jesus** had **healed** many sick people and thought,
“**I'm sure that if I can just touch Jesus’ clothes, then I will be
healed, too!**” So she came up behind Jesus and touched his clothes. As
soon as she touched them, the bleeding stopped!
