Building the Boat 03-04
=========================


**Noah** **obeyed** **God**. He and his three sons built the boat just
the way God had told them. It took many years to build the boat, because
it was so big. **Noah warned** the people about the flood that was coming
and told them to **turn to God**, but they did not believe him.

Translation Notes:
------------------

-   **Noah warned** - Noah told everyone that God planned to destroy the
    world because of sin.
-   **turn to God** - This means that they should stop sinning and start
    obeying God.
