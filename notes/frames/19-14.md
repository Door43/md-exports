Naaman Came to Elisha 19-14
=============================


After the time of **Elijah**, **God** chose a man named Elisha to be
his **prophet**.  God did many **miracles** through Elisha. One of
the miracles happened to **Naaman**, **an enemy commander**, who had a
horrible skin disease. **He had heard of Elisha** so **he went and asked
Elisha** to **heal** him. Elisha told Naaman to dip himself seven times
in the **Jordan River**.

Translation Notes:
------------------

-   **an enemy commander** - Naaman was a commander in the army of one
    of the countries that was Israel's enemy.
-   **He had heard of Elisha** - This means that people had told Naaman
    that Elisha was able to perform miracles.
-   **he went and asked Elisha** - That is, “he went to see Elisha and
    asked him.” Naaman had to go into Israel to find Elisha and ask
    him to do this.
