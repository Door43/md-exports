Jeroboam Ruled Israel 18-08
=============================


The other ten tribes of the **nation of Israel** that rebelled against
**Rehoboam appointed a man named Jeroboam to be their king**. They **set
up their kingdom** in the northern part of the land and were called the
**kingdom of Israel**.

Translation Notes:
------------------

-   **set up their kingdom** - This may be translated as, they
    “established” or, “built” their kingdom. This sentence may
    also be translated as, “They separated themselves from the other
    two tribes and lived in the northern part of the land, and they
    called their country 'Israel.'”
