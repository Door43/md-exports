Jesus and Pilate 39-09
========================


Early the next morning, the **Jewish leaders** brought **Jesus** to
**Pilate**, the **Roman governor**. They hoped that Pilate would condemn
Jesus as guilty and **sentence him to be killed**. Pilate asked Jesus,
“Are you the **king of the Jews**?”

Translation Notes:
------------------

-   **Roman governor** - That is, “Roman government official.”
The Roman
    government had appointed Pilate to govern the region of Judea
    in Israel.
-   **sentence him to be killed** - As governor, Pilate had the
    authority to condemn Jesus to death and to give approval for his
    crucifixion, or to set him free. The Jewish religious leaders did
    not have the authority to have someone killed.
