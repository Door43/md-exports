The Testimony of the Man 32-12
================================


So the man went away and told everyone about what **Jesus** had done
for him.  Everyone who **heard his story** **was filled with wonder
and amazement**.

Translation Notes:
------------------

-   **heard his story** – That is, “heard the man tell what had
happened
    to him.”
-   **was filled with wonder and amazement** - The words “amazement”
and
    “wonder” are similar in meaning. They are used together to
    emphasize how amazed the people were. This could be translated as,
    “completely astonished about what he told them.”
