God's Kingdom of Light 49-15
==============================


If you **believe** in **Jesus** and what he has done for you, you
are a **Christian**!  **God** has taken you out of **Satan's kingdom
of darkness** and put you into **God’s kingdom of light**. God has
taken away your old, sinful ways of doing things and has given you new,
righteous ways of doing things.

Translation Notes:
------------------

-   **Satan's kingdom of darkness** - “Darkness” is used here to refer
    to sin and everything that is evil. This could be translated as,
    “Satan's evil rule over people, which is like darkness.”
-   **God's kingdom of light** - “Light” here refers to God's holiness
    and goodness. This could be translated as, “God's righteous rule
    over people, which is like light.” The Bible often compares evil
    to darkness, and goodness to light.
