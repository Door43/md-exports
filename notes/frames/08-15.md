=======================


The **covenant** **promises** that **God** gave to **Abraham** were

twelve sons and their families. The **descendants** of the twelve sons
became the **twelve tribes of Israel**.

*A Bible story from: Genesis 37-50*

Translation Notes:
------------------

-   **covenant promises** - Long ago God made an agreement with Abraham
    and promised him that he would give him many descendants; they
    would possess the land of Canaan and become a great nation. God also
    promised that all peoples would be blessed through Abraham's line.
    See also
-   **passed on to** - Another way to say this would be, “passed down
    to” or, “given to” or, “applied to.” God's promise to
    Abraham was also for Abraham's children, grandchildren and all the
    rest of his descendants. See also
-   **twelve tribes of Israel** - God had promised Abraham, Isaac and
    Jacob that their descendants would become a great nation. God later
    changed Jacob's name to Israel. The descendants of Jacob's 12 sons
    became 12 great tribes. These 12 tribes made up the ancient nation
    called Israel, which was named by Jacob's new name.

    some Bible translations.
