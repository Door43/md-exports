Generous Help 27-10
=====================


“The next day, the **Samaritan** needed to **continue his journey**. He
gave some money to the person **in charge of** the inn and said,
‘**Take care of him**, and if you spend any more money than this,
I will **repay those expenses** when I return.’”

Translation Notes:
------------------

- -   **continue his journey** – This could be translated as,
“continue
    traveling toward his destination.”
-   **in charge of** – That is, “who managed.” It could be that this
    person also owned this lodging place.
-   **Take care of him** – For some languages it may be preferable to
    say, “Please take care of him” in order for it to be clear that
    this was a polite request, not an order.
-   **repay those expenses** – This could also be translated as,
“repay
    you” or, “repay that money” or, “repay it.”
