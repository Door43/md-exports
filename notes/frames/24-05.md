Not the Messiah 24-05
=======================


Some **Jews** asked **John** if he was the **Messiah**.  John replied,
“I am not the Messiah, but there is someone coming after me. **He is
so great** that I am **not even worthy to untie his sandals**.”

Translation Notes:
------------------

-   **He is so great** - This could be translated as, “He is so
    important.”
-   **not even worthy to untie his sandals** - In other words, “compared
    to him, I am not important enough to do even the most menial task
    for him.” Untying sandals was a very low job, something a slave
    would do.
