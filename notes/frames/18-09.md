Jeroboam Made an Idol 18-09
=============================


**Jeroboam** **rebelled** against **God** and **caused the people to
sin**. He built two **idols** for his people to **worship instead of
worshiping God at the Temple in the kingdom of Judah**.

Translation Notes:
------------------

-   **caused the people to sin** - This could be translated as, “led the
    people to sin” or, “motivated the people to sin.” Rehoboam
    led the people into sin by making idols for them to worship.
-   **instead of worshiping God at…Judah** - This can be translated as,
    “so that they would not worship God at” or, “instead of going
    to the kingdom of Judah to worship God at the Temple.”
