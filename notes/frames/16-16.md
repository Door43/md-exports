Gideon Made an Idol 16-16
===========================


Then **Gideon used the gold to make a special garment** like the **high
priest** used to wear. But the people started **worshiping** it as if
it were an **idol**. So **God** **punished** **Israel** again because
they worshiped idols. God allowed their enemies to defeat them. They
finally asked God for help again, and God sent them another **deliverer**.

Translation Notes:
------------------

-   **Gideon used the gold to make a special garment** – This could be
    translated as, “Gideon melted down the gold objects the people
    had given him and formed a special garment out of that gold.”
-   **turned away from God** - This could be translated as, “disobeyed
    God” or, “stopped worshiping God.”
