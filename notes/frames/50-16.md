The New Heaven and Earth 50-16
================================


Because **Adam** and **Eve** **disobeyed** **God** and **brought sin
into** this world, God **cursed** it and decided to destroy it. But
some day God will create **a new heaven** and **a new earth** that will
be perfect.

Translation Notes:
------------------

-   **brought sin into** - This could be translated as, “caused sin to
    enter.”
-   **a new heaven** - This could also be translated as, “a new
sky” or,
    “a new universe”. It refers to a new set of stars and everything
    else in the sky.
-   **a new earth** - This current earth on which we live will be
    replaced by a new and improved one.
