The Enemy Is the Devil 50-09
==============================


“The weeds represent the people **who belong to the evil one**. The
enemy who planted the weeds represents **the devil**. The harvest
**represents the end of the world**, and **the harvesters** represent
**God's** **angels**.”

Translation Notes:
------------------

-   **who belong to the evil one** - That is, “who obey the evil one”
    or, “who are ruled by the evil one.”
-   **the evil one** - This is another title for Satan. It could be
    translated as, “Satan,” but the title, “evil one” describes
    his character.
-   **the devil** - This could also be translated as, “Satan.” -
**represents the end of the world** - That is, “represents what will
    happen to people at the end of the world.”
-   **the harvesters** – This could also be translated as, “the
men who
    harvest the ripe grain” or, “the workers who gather in the
    ripe grain.”
