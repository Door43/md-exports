The Frogs 10-04
=================


**God sent frogs all over Egypt**.  **Pharaoh** **begged** **Moses**
to take away the frogs. But after all the frogs died, Pharaoh **hardened
his heart** and would not let the **Israelites** leave Egypt.

Translation Notes:

-   **God sent frogs all over Egypt** - This could be translated as,
    “God caused many frogs to appear throughout Egypt.”
-   **hardened his heart** - He became stubborn again and refused to
    obey God.
