The Herd of Pigs 32-07
========================


The **demons** **begged** **Jesus**, “Please **do not send us**
out of this region!” There was a herd of pigs feeding on a nearby
hill. So, the demons begged Jesus, “**Please send us** into the pigs
**instead**!” Jesus said, “**Go!**”

send us** – That is, “Please let us go.” -   **instead** - That
is, “instead of making us go away.” -   **Go!** – This could be
translated as, “Go into the pigs!” or, “You
    may go into the pigs!”
