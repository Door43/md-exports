Peter's Comments 36-04
========================


As **Moses** and **Elijah** were talking with **Jesus**, **Peter**
said to Jesus, “It is **good** for us to be here.  Let us make three
**shelters**, one for you, one for Moses, and one for Elijah.” Peter
**did not know what he was saying**.

Translation Notes:
------------------

-   **shelters** - This can also be translated as, “lean-tos” or,
    “garden huts” or, “tents.” It refers to small, individual,
    temporary shelters, like the Jews made from tree branches during an
    annual Jewish holiday.
-   **did not know what he was saying** - That is, “was speaking without
    understanding what was happening” or, “spoke without thinking
    clearly because he was so excited.”
