Saul Chased David 17-04
=========================


**Saul** became jealous of the people's **love** for **David**. Saul
tried many times to kill him, so David hid from Saul. **One day**, Saul
was looking for David so he could kill him. Saul went into the same cave
where David was hiding from Saul, but Saul did not see him. David was now
very close to Saul and could have killed him, but he did not. Instead,
David cut off a piece of Saul's clothes **to prove to Saul** that he
would not kill him in order to become **king**.

Translation Notes:
------------------

-   **One day** - This phrase introduces an event that happened in the
    past, but does not state the specific time. Many languages have a
    similar way to begin telling a true story.
-   **to prove to Saul** - That is, “to convince Saul” or, “to show
    Saul.”
-   **to become king** – David would not dishonor God by killing the man
    that God placed as king over Israel.
