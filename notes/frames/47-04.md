The Testimony of the Demon 47-04
==================================


The **slave girl** kept yelling as they walked, “These men are
**servants** of the **Most High God**. They are telling you **the way
to be saved**!” She did this so often that **Paul** became annoyed.

Translation Notes:
------------------

-   **the way to be saved** - That is, “how you can be saved” or,
“how
    God saves people” or, “God's plan for saving people.”
