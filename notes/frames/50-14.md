The Fire of Hell 50-14
========================


But **God** will **judge** everyone who does not **believe** in
**Jesus**. He will throw them into **hell**, where they will **weep and
grind their teeth in anguish** forever. A fire that never goes out will
continually burn them, and worms will never stop eating them.
