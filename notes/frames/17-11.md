David's Sin 17-11
===================


**Instead of looking away**, **David** sent someone to bring her to
him. **He slept with her** and sent her back home. A short time later
**Bathsheba** sent a message to David saying that she was pregnant.

Translation Notes:
------------------

-   **Instead of looking away** - That is, David did not look away from
    the woman as she bathed, as he should have done.
-   **He slept with her** - This is a polite way to say that David had
    sexual relations with Bathsheba.
