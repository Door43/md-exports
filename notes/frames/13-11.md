Make Us an Idol for Us 13-11
==============================


For many days, **Moses** was on top of **Mount Sinai** talking with
**God**. **The people became tired of waiting** for him to return. So they
**brought gold** to **Aaron** and asked him to make an **idol** for them!

Translation Notes:
------------------

-   **The people became tired of waiting** - This could be translated
    as, “The people became impatient because he did not return
    quickly” or, “The people didn't want to wait any longer for him
    to return.”
-   **brought gold** - These were objects and jewelry made of gold,
    which could be melted and formed into other things.
