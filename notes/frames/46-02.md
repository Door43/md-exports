Saul Saw Jesus 46-02
======================


While **Saul** was **on his way** to Damascus, a bright light from
heaven shone all around him, and he fell to the ground. Saul heard
someone say, “Saul! Saul! Why do you **persecute** me?” Saul asked,
“Who are you, **Master**?” Jesus replied to him, “I am Jesus. You
are persecuting me!”

Translation Notes:

-   **on his way** - That is, “on his journey.”
