A Way of Salvation 48-05
==========================


When **God** destroyed the whole earth by the flood, he provided the
boat to **save** the people who **believed** in him. In the same way,
everyone deserves to be **destroyed because of their sins**, but God
provided **Jesus** to save everyone who believes in him.

Translation Notes:
------------------

-   **destroyed because of their sins** - This could also be translated
    as, “everyone should be punished eternally by God because they
    have sinned.”
