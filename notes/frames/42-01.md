The Two Disciples 42-01
=========================


On the day that **Jesus** was **raised** from the dead, two of
his **disciples** were going to a nearby town. As they walked, they
talked about what had happened to Jesus. They had hoped that he was the
**Messiah**, but then he was killed. Now the women said he was **alive**
again. They did not know what to **believe**.
