You Are Witnesses 42-08
=========================


“It was also written in the **scriptures** that my **disciples** will
**proclaim** that everyone should **repent** in order to **receive**
**forgiveness** for their **sins**. **They will do this starting in
Jerusalem**, and then go to all **people groups** everywhere. **You are
witnesses of these things**.”

Translation Notes:

-   **proclaim** - That is, “announce” or, “preach.” -   **They
will do this starting in Jerusalem** - That is, “They will
    begin doing this in Jerusalem” or, “They will begin to proclaim
    these things in Jerusalem.”
-   **You are witnesses of these things** - That is, “You have seen
    these things happen” or, “You will tell other people the things
    that you have seen happen.”
