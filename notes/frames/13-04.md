I Am Your God 13-04
=====================


**Then God gave them the covenant and said**, “I am **Yahweh, your
God**, **who saved you from slavery** in **Egypt**. Do not **worship**
other **gods**.”

Translation Notes:
------------------

-   **Then God gave them the covenant and said** - What God says next is
    the content of the covenant, that is, he tells the people the things
    that they must obey. This could be translated as, “Then God told
    them His covenant. He said” or, “Then God made this covenant
    with them:”
-   **Yahweh your God** - In some languages it might be more natural to
    change the order and say “your God Yahweh.” Make sure it does
    not sound like the Israelites had more than one God. It should be
    clear that Yahweh is the only God. Another way to translate this
    would be, “Yahweh, who is your God” or, “your God, whose name
    is Yahweh.”
-   **who saved you from slavery** - This could be translated as, “I
    freed you from slavery.”
