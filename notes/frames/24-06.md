Jesus Is the Lamb of God 24-06
================================


The next day, **Jesus** came to be **baptized** by **John**. When John
saw him, he said, “Look! **There is** the **Lamb of God** who **will
take away** the **sin of the world**.”

Translation Notes:
------------------

-   **There is** – For some languages this would be, “Here is”
or, “That
    man is.”
-   **Lamb of God** - This could also be translated as, “the Lamb from
    God” or, “the sacrifice Lamb that God has provided.” Jesus
    was the perfect sacrifice for sin that God promised to provide. He
    fulfills the image that was presented by the sacrifice of lambs in
    the Old Testament.
-   **will take away** - The sacrifice of Jesus causes God to look at
    our sin as if it never existed.
-   **sin of the world** - That is, “the sin of the people in the
    world.”
