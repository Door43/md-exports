God's People 48-07
====================


**God** told **Abraham**, “**All the people groups of the earth**
will be **blessed** through you.” **Jesus** was a **descendant**of
Abraham. All the people groups are blessed through him, because everyone
who **believes** in Jesus is **saved** from sin, and becomes **a spiritual
descendant of Abraham**.

Translation Notes:
------------------

-   **all the people groups of the earth** – This could also be
    translated as, “people from all different parts of the world.”
-   **a spiritual descendant of Abraham** - That is, “spiritually
    related to Abraham, and one of God's people.”
