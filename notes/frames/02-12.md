Out of the Garden 02-12
=========================


Then **God** said, “Now that the human beings have become **like us by
knowing good and evil**, they must not be allowed to eat the **fruit** of
the **tree of life** and live forever.” So God sent **Adam** and **Eve**
away from the beautiful garden. God placed large, powerful **angels**
at the entrance to the garden to keep anyone from eating the fruit of
the tree of life.

*A Bible story from: Genesis 3*

Translation Notes:
------------------

-   **like us by knowing good and evil** - Here, this phrase points to a
    new way that Adam and Eve would be like God. Because they had sinned,
    they were aware of evil and could experience it. You could say,
    “because now they knew both good and evil.”
-   **fruit** - The specific kind of fruit is not revealed, so it is
    best to translate this using a general word for fruit.
-   **tree of life** - This was an actual tree with fruit. See
    If a person ate this fruit he would live continually and never die.
-   *A Bible story from* - These references may be slightly different in
    some Bible translations.
