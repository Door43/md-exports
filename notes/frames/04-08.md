No Son 04-08
==============


**Many years** went by, but **Abram** and **Sarai** still did not have
a **son**.  **God** spoke to Abram and **promised** again that he would
have a son and as many **descendants as the stars in the sky**. Abram
**believed** God's promise. God declared that Abram was **righteous**
because he believed in God's promise.

Translation Notes:
------------------

-   **Many years** - Several years had passed since God had first
    promised that Abram would have a son.
-   **as the stars in the sky** - This expression means that Abram's
    descendants will be so many that no one can count them all.
