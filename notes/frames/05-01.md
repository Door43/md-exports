Hagar 05-01
=============


Ten years after **Abram** and **Sarai** arrived in **Canaan**, **they
still did not have a child**. So Abram's wife, Sarai, said to him,
“Since **God** has not allowed me to have children and now I am too
old to have children, here is my **servant, Hagar**. **Marry her also**
so she can **have a child for me**.”

Translation Notes:
------------------

-   **still did not have a child** - Without a child, Abram had no
    descendants to become a great nation.
-   **Marry her also** - Abram would take Hagar as a second wife, but
    Hagar would not have the full status of a wife as Sarai did. She
    was still Sarai's servant.
-   **have a child for me** - Since Hagar was Sarai's servant, Sarai
    would be considered the mother of any children that Hagar bore.
