Test of Faith 05-06
=====================


When **Isaac** was a young man, **God tested Abraham's faith** by saying,
“Take Isaac, your only **son**, and **kill him** as a **sacrifice** to
me.” Again Abraham **obeyed** God and **prepared to sacrifice** his son.

Translation Notes:
------------------

-   **God tested Abraham's faith** - God wanted Abraham to show that he
    was completely submitted to God, that he would obey whatever God
    told him to do.
-   **kill him** - God did not want human sacrifice. God wanted to see
    that Abraham loved God more than he loved his son and would obey
    God even when God told him to give his son back to God.
-   **prepared to sacrifice** - Abraham got ready to sacrifice his son.
    God stopped him before he killed his son.
