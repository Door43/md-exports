The King of the Jews 39-12
============================


**Pilate** became afraid that the crowd would begin to **riot**, so he
ordered his soldiers to **crucify** **Jesus**. The **Roman** soldiers
whipped Jesus and put **a royal robe** and a **crown made of thorns**
on him.  Then they **mocked** him by saying, “**Look**, **the King of
the Jews**!”

*A Bible story from: Matthew 26:57-27:26; Mark 14:53-15:15; Luke
22:54-23:25; John 18:12-19:16*

Translation Notes:
------------------

-   **riot** - That is, “start doing violent things in their anger.” -
**a royal robe** - That is, “a robe like a king's robe.” This robe
    had a bright color, so it looked like the kind of robe that a king
    would wear.
-   **crown made of thorns** - This means that they tied thorn branches
    into a circle to look like a crown. A crown is an ornament that a
    king wears on his head to show his authority. But the crown that
    they put on Jesus' head had sharp, dangerous thorns on it.
-   **Look** – That is, “Look at” or, ”Here is.” -   **the
King of the Jews** – Since the soldiers were mocking Jesus,
    this could be translated as, “the so-called King of the Jews.”
-   *A Bible story from* - These references may be slightly different in
    some Bible translations.
