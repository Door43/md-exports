Jesus Healed the Sick 26-08
=============================


Then **Jesus** **went throughout the region of Galilee**, and large crowds
came to him. They brought many people who were sick or handicapped,
including those who could not see, walk, hear, or speak, and Jesus
**healed** them.

Translation Notes:
------------------

-   **went throughout the region of Galilee** - That is, “all around in
    Galilee” or, “from place to place in Galilee.”
