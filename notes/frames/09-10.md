Moses Fled from Egypt 09-10
=============================


When **Pharaoh** heard what **Moses** had done, he tried to kill
him. Moses ran away from **Egypt** to the **wilderness** where he would
be safe from Pharaoh's soldiers.

Translation Notes:
------------------

-   **wilderness** - The wilderness was a large area that was rocky and
    dry. The land there was not good for growing food and few people
    lived there.
