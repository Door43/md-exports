Breaking the Chains 32-03
===========================


This man was so strong that nobody could control him. People had even
**fastened** his arms and legs with chains, but he **kept breaking them**.

Translation Notes:
------------------

-   **fastened his arms and legs** - That is, “restrained” or,
“bound.” -   **kept breaking them** - Some languages may need to
say, “kept
    breaking the chains.”
