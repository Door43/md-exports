A Call to Repent 24-02
========================


Many people came out to the **wilderness** to listen to **John**. He
**preached** to them, saying, “**Repent**, for **the kingdom of God
is near**!”

Translation Notes:
------------------

-   **wilderness** - See how you translated this word in -   **Repent**
- It might be better to say, “Repent from your sins.” -   **the
kingdom of God is near** - That is, “the kingdom of God is
    ready to appear” or, “the kingdom of God will arrive soon.” This
    refers to God's ruling over people. This can also be translated as,
    “God's reign is about to begin” or, “God will soon rule over
    us as king.”
