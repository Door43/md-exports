Judah Was Unfaithful 18-13
============================


The **kings** of **Judah** were **descendants** of **David**. Some of
these kings were **good** men who **ruled justly** and **worshiped**
**God**. But most of Judah’s kings were **evil**, **corrupt**, and
they worshiped **idols**. Some of the kings even **sacrificed** their
children to false **gods**. Most of the people of Judah also **rebelled**
against God and worshiped other gods.
