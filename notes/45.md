45. Philip and the Ethiopian Official
=====================================

Overview:
---------

Most of the Jewish religious rulers did not believe in Jesus, and were
upset that the disciples were preaching that he had risen from the dead.
They killed one of the disciples named Stephen in Jerusalem. This
was the start of a persecution that scattered the believers. But the
disciples preached about Jesus everywhere they went. One day, the Holy
Spirit brought Philip to a desert road to meet an Ethiopian official.
When Philip explained to him about Jesus, the official believed and
Philip baptized him.
