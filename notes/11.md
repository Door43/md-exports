11. The Passover
================

Overview:
---------

God told Pharaoh to let Israel go, or his angel would kill all of the
firstborn people and animals. But God told Israel to kill a lamb and
put its blood over the door of their houses. The firstborn of Israel
survived, but all of the firstborn of Egypt died—even Pharaoh’s son.
This caused Pharaoh and the Egyptians to send Israel away from Egypt
immediately.
