27. The Story of the Good Samaritan
===================================

Overview:
---------

A lawyer asked Jesus how he could have eternal life. He thought he
had kept Godâ€™s law enough to be righteous. So Jesus told him a story
about a man who was wounded by robbers. Religious leaders passed by,
but a Samaritan helped him and paid for his care at a hotel. Jesus told
the lawyer that he must show mercy as the Samaritan did in order to
be righteous.
