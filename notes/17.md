17. God's Covenant with David
=============================

Overview:
---------

Saul, the first king of Israel, did not obey God. So God chose David to
be king instead. God helped David defeat his enemies and protected him
from Saul. God also promised that the Messiah would be a descendent of
David. Despite Godâ€™s provision, David sinned at the end of his life. He
murdered Uriah and took his wife. But God forgave David when he repented,
and continued to bless David and his son, Solomon.
