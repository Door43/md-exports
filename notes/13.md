13. God's Covenant with Israel
==============================

Overview:
---------

God led the Israelites to Mount Sinai in the wilderness to worship him.
He gave them the Ten Commandments on tablets of stone, and many other
commandments. But the people grew tired of waiting for God and made
an idol. Moses was very angry with the people, and God sent a plague
that killed many of them. But God forgave the people when Moses prayed
for them.
