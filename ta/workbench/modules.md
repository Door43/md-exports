Modules
=======

Modules are structured as answers to questions. These are some of the
questions needing answers:

1.  What is meaning-based translation?  2.  Why should I do a
meaning-based translation?  3.  How do I do a meaning-based translation?
4.  How do I translate something that does not exist in my language?  5.
What do I do if what I understand the text to say is impossible?
    (Jesus walking *on top* of the water? How do I distinguish the
    miraculous from a figure of speech such as “He was walking on
    thin ice”?)
6.  What do I do if there is something more I need to know in order to
    translate it into my language? (Such as formal versus familiar forms
    of 'you', singular versus dual or plural forms of 'you')?
7.  What do I do if people give the wrong answer to a comprehension
    question? (Distinguishing lack of clarity in a translation from lack
    of background knowledge on the part of the audience.)
8.  How should I translate names of people and places that I do not have
    in my language?
9.  How can I tell if terms in the story mean the same thing as they do
    in my culture?
10. How should I translate forms of address?  11. What if I don't
understand how the action in the frames is
    connected?
12. What do I do if something is stated in a way that I cannot translate
    into my language?
13. What do I do if the text I am translating has a cultural practice
    that is foreign to my context?
14. How do I edit pages and text in the translation interface?  15. What
is my personal beliefs or the beliefs of my denomination do not
    agree with the OBS text?
16. likened to \#9 What if something in the OBS text (a cultural form
    in the story, so to speak) carries a bad or evil connotation in
    my culture?
