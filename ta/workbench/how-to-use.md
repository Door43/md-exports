How to Add My Information
-------------------------

All the pages under the “workbench” namespace are inputs for
translation training resources.

#### Suggestion: You might find it convenient to right click on links
and choose "Open in new window."

Adding content in Door43 is easy! Follow these simple steps to get
started:

1. Create an Account & Log into Door43
--------------------------------------

To start adding content, you will need a user account on Door43. If you
do not have an account, create one then you can login.\
 You can watch this
video (45 seconds long) to see how to set up an account.

-   Click on the Register link at the top of the page.  -   Fill in the
necessary information to set up an account.  -   Check your email for
the automatic generated password. (You might
    find the email in your spam folder.)
-   Click on the 'Update Profile' link to change the password.

2. Practice Editing a Page
--------------------------

Door43 has a test page that you can freely edit to try things out.
Here is a short video  on how to switch between the text editor and the
graphical editor.

**Graphical Editor** – When you click the “Edit this page” button,
you will probably see an edit window that looks like a simplified word
processor. Click here for the “how to” 1 minute video. The buttons
take care of formatting text and generally make it easier to use. Here
is information on the toolbar icons: quickbuttons.

**Text Editor** – If you prefer, you can click the “DW Edit”
button beneath the edit box to switch to a text-based editor. This is the
standard DokuWiki editor and it provides full control over the syntax of
the text. Go to the Formatting Text page for some simple editing formats
to use in the text editor.

*Note:* when using the text editor, you can switch back to the graphical
editor by clicking the “FCK Edit” button.

3. Add a Page
-------------

Adding a page is easy! In - the URL field of the Internet browser add
a title of your page to end of the workbench URL.

1.  You will add to the end of
    http://door43.org/en/ta/workbench/ the title of your page.
2.  Press the enter key.  3.  You will open a new page that says “This
page does not exist yet”.  4.  Left click on the Pencil with the plus
sign to create the page.  5.  Start writing in your information.

It's that simple! The title of your page can be anything. If you find
a page with that already exists, please try another page name. Why not
put a number at the end of the title?

Please add a **discussion panel** to the bottom of every page. A
discussion panel allows others to comment on your work and share their
thoughts and resources on what you have written. Here is how to add a
discussion panel on your page.

~~~~ {.code} Type in ~~Discussion~~ at the bottom of the page. The
discussion panel will appear below your information.  ~~~~

4. Add Tags to a Page
---------------------

After you know how to edit a page and add a new page, we ask that you
add tags to every one of your pages. Tags are a way to categorize the
topics of your page. For example, if you were writing about Hebrew text
for Genesis, you would tag your page with the words “Hebrew” and
“Genesis.” Here are instructions on how to add tags to your page.

~~~~ {.code} {{tag>tag1}} Where the words 'tag1' is replaced by a
topic on your page.  For instance, if you were writing about Hebrew
the tag would read: {{tag>Hebrew}}.  Spaces between words will set
multiple tags. For example: {{tag>Hebrew}} will make a "Hebrew" tag but
{{tag>Hebrew Genesis}} will make two tags - one for "Hebrew" and one for
"Genesis."  ~~~~

You can copy the code above and just replace “Hebrew” and
“Genesis” with your topics.
